Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 84 children with pathologically confirmed CDCs treated in the Children's Hospital of Soochow University. 180 patients without CDCs as a control to analysis the hepatic artery and portal vein anatomy. All patients were examined by multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) and the images of children with CDC were reconstructed by Hisense computer-assisted surgery system (Hisense CAS) to obtain visual 3D images. Results: There were 71 females and 13 males diagnosed with CDC. According to Todani classification of CDC, there were 42 cases of type Ia, 10 cases of type Ic and 32 cases of type IVa. There were 10 (11.9%) patients with hepatic artery variations, 14 (16.7%) patients with right hepatic artery located on the ventral side of the CDC, and 16 (19.0%) patients with portal vein variations. Sex, age and types of the cyst were not associated with the presence of vascular variations. There was no significant difference in hepatic vascular variation between CDCs and control groups. Visual 3D images clearly displayed the hepatic vascular variations and the spatial structure of the CDC in pediatric patients with CDC. Conclusions: Hepatic artery and portal vein variations can be detected in pediatric patients with CDC. Visual 3D technique can visually and stereoscopically display the anatomical variations of the hepatic artery and portal vein. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Choledochal cyst; Hepatic vascular variation; Pediatric; Visual three-dimensional reconstruction","Anatomic Variation; Child; Child, Preschool; Choledochal Cyst; Female; Hepatic Artery; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Portal Vein; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; anatomical variation; Article; capillary; child; common bile duct cyst; controlled study; extrahepatic bile duct; female; hepatic artery; hepatic portal vein; human; intrahepatic bile duct; liver blood vessel; major clinical study; male; multidetector computed tomography; pediatric patient; priority journal; retrospective study; splenic vein; superior mesenteric artery; superior mesenteric vein; three-dimensional imaging; common bile duct cyst; diagnostic imaging; preschool child; three-dimensional imaging; x-ray computed tomography","","Springer-Verlag Italia s.r.l.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092297120"

The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of the 8th AJCC staging system for T1-2N1 breast cancer and to assess the effect of additional chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the new pathologic stages. Methods: The cohort included patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (2010–2012) who had stage T1-2N1 invasive breast carcinoma and underwent mastectomy. All patients were restaged using the 8th AJCC staging system. The Kaplan–Meier method, Cox proportional hazards regression, and competing risks models were used for data analysis. Results: We identified 9908 patients including 3022 (30.5%), 3131 (31.6%), 1940 (19.6%), 1194 (12.1%), and 621 (6.3%) were classified with stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, and IIIA disease, respectively. The 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was 97.3%, 94.3%, 88.3%, 84.0%, and 71.1% for stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, and IIIA disease, respectively. Higher pathological stage was associated with a significantly higher risk of breast cancer-related death. Chemotherapy was associated with better BCSS regardless of the pathological stage, but radiotherapy was only associated with better BCSS in stage IIIA disease. Conclusions: The 8th AJCC pathological staging system provides more refined stratification for T1-2N1 breast cancer patients after mastectomy and may meet the needs of the current trend of individualized decision making for chemotherapy and radiotherapy in this patient subset. © 2020 The Author(s)","AJCC; Breast cancer; Chemotherapy; Mastectomy; Radiotherapy","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; SEER Program; Survival Analysis; antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; breast carcinoma; cancer chemotherapy; cancer classification; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; clinical assessment tool; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; controlled study; high risk patient; histopathology; human; major clinical study; mastectomy; priority journal; survival rate; tumor invasion; validation study; breast tumor; cancer registry; cancer staging; female; middle aged; pathology; survival analysis; very elderly","","Churchill Livingstone","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081257135"

Whether histological subtype affects survival still remains unclear. The main objective of this study was to determine the extent to which the survival outcomes of patients with early-stage NSCLC differ by histological subtype. Material and methods: Retrospective cohort study of SEER data base. Patients with stage IA and IB NSCLC that underwent surgery with lymph node dissection were included. The primary outcome was the time to death. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors associated with overall survival (OS). The secondary outcome was the time to death from lung cancer. A Cox model and a Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model in which death from causes other than lung cancer was considered a competing risk event were used to identify risk factors for death from lung cancer. Results: Analysis of the SEER database identified 28,584 NSCLC patients, of whom 19,750 (69 %) had adenocarcinoma and 8834 (31 %) had squamous cell carcinoma. In the multivariate for OS, older age (p < 0.001), male gender (p < 0.001), pneumonectomy (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p < 0.001), squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0.001) not being Hispanic or Asian were associated with increased risk of death. In the competing risk model, older age (p < 0.001), male gender (p < 0.001), pneumonectomy (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p < 0.001), and squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0.001) were was associated with an increased risk of death from lung cancer. Conclusion: This study suggests that among patients with stage I NSCLC, those with squamous histology have a higher risk of mortality than those with adenocarcinoma histology taking into account competing risks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Lung cancer histology; Non–small cell lung cancer","Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pneumonectomy; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; SEER Program; Survival Rate; Young Adult; adult; age; aged; Article; Asian; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; disease association; female; health disparity; Hispanic; histopathology; human; lung adenocarcinoma; lung resection; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; mortality risk; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; sex difference; squamous cell lung carcinoma; survival rate; survival time; time of death; treatment outcome; cancer registry; follow up; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; risk factor; squamous cell carcinoma; very elderly; young adult","","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076520605"

During a period of 1 year (from Jan 2016 to Dec 2016), consecutive patients with suspected PTB were included in a referral TB hospital. Data, including demographic information and underlying diseases, were collected from medical records. PTB were all confirmed by mycobacterial culture (Lowenstein-Jensen medium). IA were diagnosed as proven or probable according to the criteria of the 2008 EORTC/MSG definitions. A descriptive analysis was performed to estimate the corresponding prevalence. During the study year, 1507 patients have a positive mycobacterial culture, with a mean age of 45.6 (SD 19.9) years old and a female: male ratio of 1:4. Among the 82 patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases, 2 patients (2.44%, 95% CI: 0.67%-8.46%) were diagnosed as IA (1 proven and 1 probable); 2 probable IA patients (0.15%, 95% CI: 0.04%-0.55%) were diagnosed in PTB patients (n=1315), and all were retreatment cases. In addition, all the 4 IA patients (100%) exhibited cavities in both lobes on radiograph. In China, the prevalence of IA is low in active PTB patients. However, when high risk factors for IA are encountered in PTB patients, further investigations are required and empirically treatment for IA might be warranted. © The Authors 2020.","Aspergillus; Cavity; Prevalence; Tuberculosis","","","Cambridge University Press","English","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097255985"

The study was initiated because reports of low autoantibody prevalence and phenotypic differences from European-origin cases with type 1 diabetes have raised doubts as to the role of autoimmunity in this and similar populations. Methods: A study of consecutive, unselected cases of recently diagnosed, insulin-dependent diabetes (n = 236, ≤35 years) and control participants (n = 200) was carried out in the ethnic Amhara of rural North-West Ethiopia. We assessed their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and measured non-fasting C-peptide, diabetes-associated autoantibodies and HLA-DRB1 alleles. Leveraging genome-wide genotyping, we performed both a principal component analysis and, given the relatively modest sample size, a provisional genome-wide association study. Type 1 diabetes genetic risk scores were calculated to compare their genetic background with known European type 1 diabetes determinants. Results: Patients presented with stunted growth and low BMI, and were insulin sensitive; only 15.3% had diabetes onset at ≤15 years. C-peptide levels were low but not absent. With clinical diabetes onset at ≤15, 16–25 and 26–35 years, 86.1%, 59.7% and 50.0% were autoantibody positive, respectively. Most had autoantibodies to GAD (GADA) as a single antibody; the prevalence of positivity for autoantibodies to IA-2 (IA-2A) and ZnT8 (ZnT8A) was low in all age groups. Principal component analysis showed that the Amhara genomes were distinct from modern European and other African genomes. HLA-DRB1*03:01 (p = 0.0014) and HLA-DRB1*04 (p = 0.0001) were positively associated with this form of diabetes, while HLA-DRB1*15 was protective (p < 0.0001). The mean type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (derived from European data) was higher in patients than control participants (p = 1.60 × 10−7). Interestingly, despite the modest sample size, autoantibody-positive patients revealed evidence of association with SNPs in the well-characterised MHC region, already known to explain half of type 1 diabetes heritability in Europeans. Conclusions/interpretation: The majority of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes in rural North-West Ethiopia have the immunogenetic characteristics of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Phenotypic differences between type 1 diabetes in rural North-West Ethiopia and the industrialised world remain unexplained. © 2020, The Author(s).","Africa; Autoantibodies; Ethiopia; Genomes; HLA; Rural; Type 1 diabetes","Adolescent; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Age of Onset; Autoantibodies; C-Peptide; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Ethiopia; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; HLA-DRB1 Chains; Humans; Male; Principal Component Analysis; Young Adult; Zinc Transporter 8; autoantibody; C peptide; glutamate decarboxylase antibody; HLA DQB1 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; insulin; islet antigen 2 antibody; unclassified drug; zinc transporter 8 antibody; Anti-GAD65 autoantibody; autoantibody; C peptide; HLA DRB1 antigen; ICA512 autoantibody; SLC30A8 protein, human; zinc transporter 8; adult; African; Amhara (people); Article; autoimmunity; body mass; controlled study; Ethiopia; European; female; gene locus; genetic risk; genetic risk score; genome; genome-wide association study; human; immunogenetics; insulin sensitivity; major clinical study; major histocompatibility complex; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; rural population; single nucleotide polymorphism; stunting; adolescent; Black person; blood; child; Ethiopia; genetics; genome-wide association study; immunology; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; onset age; principal component analysis; young adult","","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088504662"

However, these data are subject to diverse sources of variation, including 'unwanted' variation that needs to be removed in downstream analyses (e.g. batch effects) and 'wanted' or biological sources of variation (e.g. variation associated with a cell type) that needs to be precisely described. Surrogate variable analysis (SVA)-based algorithms, are commonly used for batch correction and more recently for studying 'wanted' variation in scRNA-seq data. However, interpreting whether these variables are biologically meaningful or stemming from technical reasons remains a challenge. To facilitate the interpretation of surrogate variables detected by algorithms including IA-SVA, SVA or ZINB-WaVE, we developed an R Shiny application [Visual Surrogate Variable Analysis (V-SVA)] that provides a web-browser interface for the identification and annotation of hidden sources of variation in scRNA-seq data. This interactive framework includes tools for discovery of genes associated with detected sources of variation, gene annotation using publicly available databases and gene sets, and data visualization using dimension reduction methods.

Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids and/or oral opioids are often recommended for the management of knee OA pain. There are, however, concerns regarding their safety and tolerability. Study Question: Do patients diagnosed with knee OA show a decrease in opioids or IA corticosteroid injections prescribed/administered in hospitals following hylan G-F 20 treatment? Study Design: This case-crossover, retrospective study using Health Facts®, a de-identified electronic health records database, enrolled patients ≥18 years with knee OA treated with hylan G-F 20 between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2016, with data within 6 months before/after treatment. Measures and Outcomes: Primary endpoints compared days on opioids, amounts of opioids, and number of IA corticosteroid injections before/after hylan G-F 20 treatment via paired t-tests. Results: A total of 513 patients were qualified for analysis. In the opioid cohort, the average total number of days on opioids (N = 50; 5.0 vs 13.5 days; P = 0.007) and average total amount of opioids (N = 44; 165.4 morphine mg equivalents [MME] vs 493.7 MME; P = 0.013) were lower 6 months after hylan G-F 20 treatment than 6 months before treatment. In the IA corticosteroid cohort, the average number of IA corticosteroid injections decreased after hylan G-F 20 treatment (N = 36; 0.56 in the 6-month follow-up vs 1.39 before treatment; P < 0.0001). Additional time frames of 1–5 months before and after treatment were examined; similar conclusions were drawn for patients with >2 months of data.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study followed 7,522 genetically high-risk children in Sweden, Finland, Germany, and the U.S. from birth for a median of 9.0 years (interquartile range 5.7–10.6) with available growth data. Of these, 761 (10.1%) children developed IA and 290 (3.9%) children were diagnosed with T1D. Bayesian two-phase piecewise linear mixed models with a random change point were used to estimate children’s individual growth trajectories. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the effects of associated growth parameters on the risks of IA and progression to T1D. RESULTS A higher rate of weight gain in infancy was associated with increased IA risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.02, 1.17] per 1 kg/year). A height growth pattern with a lower rate in infancy (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.70, 0.90] per 1 cm/year), higher rate in early childhood (HR 1.48 [95% CI 1.22, 1.79] per 1 cm/year), and younger age at the phase transition (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.58, 0.99] per 1 month) was associated with increased risk of progression from IA to T1D. A higher rate of weight gain in early childhood was associated with increased risk of progression from IA to T1D (HR 2.57 [95% CI 1.34, 4.91] per 1 kg/year) in children with first-appearing GAD autoantibody only. CONCLUSIONS Growth patterns in early life better clarify how specific growth phases are associated with the development of T1D. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adolescent; Body-Weight Trajectory; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Disease Progression; Female; Finland; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germany; Growth Charts; Humans; Infant; Male; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sweden; United States; autoantibody; growth hormone; HLA DQA1 antigen; HLA DQB1 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; insulin; somatomedin binding protein 3; somatomedin C; antibody detection; Article; Bayesian network; body weight gain; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease course; disease risk assessment; Finland; genetic association; genetic risk; genotype; Germany; growth rate; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin release; insulin resistance; major clinical study; preschool child; proportional hazards model; prospective study; risk factor; school child; sensitivity and specificity; Sweden; United States; adolescent; child development; disease exacerbation; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; growth chart; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; pathology; physiology","","American Diabetes Association Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081144972"

We reviewed our multicenter experience in clinical detection/treatment of IAs in AAA patients and estimated the risk of IA in patients with AAA relative to patients without AAA. We reviewed cases of vascular surgery infrarenal AAA repairs at three Mayo Clinic sites from January 1998 to December 2018. Concurrent controls were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, smoking history, and head imaging characteristics. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios. We reviewed 2,300 infrarenal AAA repairs. Mean size of AAA at repair was 56.9 ± 11.4 mm; mean age at repair, 75.8 ± 8.0 years. 87.5% of the cases (n = 2014) were men. Head imaging was available in 421 patients. Thirty-seven patients were found to have 45 IAs for a prevalence of 8.8%. Mean size of IA was 4.6 ± 3.5 mm; mean age at IA detection, 72.0 ± 10.8 years. Thirty (81%) out of 37 patients were men. Six patients underwent treatment for IA: four for ruptured IAs and two for unruptured IAs. All were diagnosed before AAA repair. Treatment included five clippings and one coil-Assisted stenting. Time from IA diagnosis to AAA repair was 16.4 ± 11.0 years. Two of these patients presented with ruptured AAA, one with successful repair and a second one that resulted in death. Odds of IA were higher for patients with AAA versus those without AAA (8.8% [37/421] vs. 3.1% [13/421]; OR 3.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-6.27, p < 0.001). Co-prevalence of IA among patients with AAA was 8.8% and is more than three times the rate seen in patients without AAA. All IAs were diagnosed prior to AAA repair. Surveillance for AAA after IA treatment could have prevented two AAA ruptures and one death. © 2020 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

Objective To investigate potential FIA-causing genetic variants by rare variant interrogation and a family-based genomics approach in a large family with an extensive multigenerational pedigree with FIAs. Method Exome sequencing (ES) was performed in a dominant likely family with intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Variants were analyzed by an in-house developed pipeline and prioritized using various filtering strategies, including population frequency, variant type, and predicted variant pathogenicity. Sanger sequencing was also performed to evaluate the segregation of the variants with the phenotype. Results Based on the ES data obtained from five individuals from a family with 7/21 living members affected with IAs, a total of 14 variants were prioritized as candidate variants. Familial segregation analysis revealed that NFX1 c.2519T>C (p.Leu840Pro) segregated in accordance with Mendelian expectations with the phenotype within the family - that is, present in all IA-affected cases and absent from all unaffected members of the second generation. This missense variant is absent from public databases (1000genome, ExAC, gnomAD, ESP5400), and has damaging predictions by bioinformatics tools (Gerp ++ score = 5.88, CADD score = 16.43, MutationTaster score = 1, LRT score = 0). In addition, 840Leu in NFX1 is robustly conserved in mammals and maps in a region before the RING-type zinc finger domain. Conclusion NFX1 c.2519T>C (p.Leu840Pro) may contribute to the pathogenetics of a subset of FIAs. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

It is not known fully how various BP measurement techniques differ from one another.Study Objective: The study hypothesized that there are differences in the accuracy of various non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement strategies as compared to the gold standard of intra-arterial (IA) measurement.Methods: The study enrolled adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with radial IA catheters placed to measure radial intra-arterial blood pressure (RIBP) as a part of their standard care at a large, urban, tertiary-care Level I trauma center. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was taken by three different NIBP techniques (oscillometric, auscultated, and palpated) and compared to RIBP measurements. Data were analyzed using the paired t-test with dependent samples to detect differences between RIBP measurements and each NIBP method. The primary outcome was the difference in RIBP and NIBP measurement. There was also a predetermined subgroup analysis based on gender, body mass index (BMI), primary diagnosis requiring IA line placement, and current vasoactive medication use.Results: Forty-four patients were enrolled to detect a predetermined clinically significant difference of 5mmHg in SBP. The patient population was 63.6% male and 36.4% female with an average age of 58.4 years old. The most common primary diagnoses were septic shock (47.7%), stroke (13.6%), and increased intracranial pressure (ICP; 13.6%). Most patients were receiving some form of sedation (63.4%), while 50.0% were receiving vasopressor medication and 31.8% were receiving anti-hypertensive medication. When compared to RIBP values, only the palpated SBP values had a clinically significant difference (9.88mmHg less than RIBP; P <.001). When compared to RIBP, the oscillometric and auscultated SBP readings showed statistically but not clinically significant lower values. The palpated method also showed a clinically significant lower SBP reading than the oscillometric method (5.48mmHg; P <.001) and the auscultated method (5.06mmHg; P <.001). There was no significant difference between the oscillometric and auscultated methods (0.42mmHg; P =.73).Conclusion: Overall, NIBPs significantly under-estimated RIBP measurements. Palpated BP measurements were consistently lower than RIBP, which was statistically and clinically significant. These results raise concern about the accuracy of palpated BP and its pervasive use in prehospital care. The data also suggested that auscultated and oscillometric BP may provide similar measurements.  © 2020 World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine.","arterial pressure; blood pressure; blood pressure monitor; sphygmomanometer","Arterial Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Trauma Centers; arterial pressure; blood pressure measurement; comparative study; emergency health service; female; human; intensive care unit; male; middle aged; procedures","","Cambridge University Press","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091323890"

The phosphatase Rtr1 has been shown to regulate serine 5 phosphorylation on the CTD; however, its role in the regulation of RNAPII termination has not been explored. As a consequence of RTR1 deletion, interactions within the termination machinery and between the termination machinery and RNAPII were altered as quantified by Disruption-Compensation (DisCo) network analysis. Of note, interactions between RNAPII and the cleavage factor IA (CF1A) subunit Pcf11 were reduced in rtr1Δ, whereas interactions with the CTD and RNA-binding termination factor Nrd1 were increased. Globally, rtr1Δ leads to decreases in numerous noncoding RNAs that are linked to the Nrd1, Nab3 and Sen1 (NNS) -dependent RNAPII termination pathway. Genome-wide analysis of RNAPII and Nrd1 occupancy suggests that loss of RTR1 leads to increased termination at noncoding genes. Additionally, premature RNAPII termination increases globally at protein-coding genes with a decrease in RNAPII occupancy occurring just after the peak of Nrd1 recruitment during early elongation. The effects of rtr1Δ on RNA expression levels were lost following deletion of the exosome subunit Rrp6, which works with the NNS complex to rapidly degrade a number of noncoding RNAs following termination. Overall, these data suggest that Rtr1 restricts the NNS-dependent termination pathway in WT cells to prevent premature termination of mRNAs and ncRNAs. Rtr1 facilitates low-level elongation of noncoding transcripts that impact RNAPII interference thereby shaping the transcriptome. Copyright: © 2020 Victorino et al.

For patients without LN metastasis, the main role of thorough LN examination is accurate staging, which weakens the effect of staging migration. To date, the role of hilar and intrapulmonary (N1) station LNs has not been fully appreciated. In this study, we aimed to confirm the significance of N1 LNs in long-term survival for stage IA-IIA NSCLC patients and to find the minimum number of LN to examine. Methods: The data of patients who underwent radical lobectomy and were confirmed as having non-metastatic LNs from January 2008 to March 2018 were retrospectively screened. Pathology records were reviewed for the number of LNs examined. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to identify survival and prognostic factors. Results: The median number of resected N1 LNs was 8. The number of patients with 0-2 N1 LNs, 3-5 N1 LNs, 6-8 N1 LNs, 9-11 N1 LNs, and more than 11 N1 LNs examined was 181, 425, 477, 414, and 531, respectively. Sex (P = 0.004), age (P < 0.001), tumor size (P = 0.004), differentiation degree (P = 0.001), and number of N1 LNs examined (P = 0.008) were independent prognostic factors of overall survival. Gender (P = 0.006), age (P = 0.031), tumor size (P = 0.001), differentiation degree (P = 0.001), vascular invasion (P = 0.034), and number of N1 LNs examined (P = 0.007) were independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival. Compared with patients with 0-5 N1 LNs examined, patients with more than 5 N1 LNs examined had better OS (P = 0.015) and had better DFS (P = 0.015) if only a landmark 5-year follow-up was performed. Conclusion: Increasing the number of N1 LN examination might improve the long-term survival of T1-2N0 NSCLC patients. These data indicate that at least 6 N1 nodes examined is an essential part in surgical and pathological management but cannot prove this. This finding should be confirmed in a large, prospective randomized clinical study.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Lymph node; Non-small cell lung cancer; Prognosis","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; accuracy; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; disease free survival; female; follow up; human; lymphatic system examination; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; retrospective study; trend study; tumor differentiation; tumor volume; controlled study; lung tumor; lymph node; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; prognosis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092541615"

Here, we aimed to characterise type 1 diabetes heterogeneity by creating immunological, genetic and clinical profiles for individuals with juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes in a cross-sectional study. Methods: Participants were HLA-genotyped to determine HLA-DR-DQ risk, and SNP-genotyped to generate a non-HLA genetic risk score (GRS) based on 93 type 1 diabetes-associated SNP variants outside the MHC region. Islet autoimmunity was assessed as T cell proliferation upon stimulation with the beta cell antigens GAD65, islet antigen-2 (IA-2), preproinsulin (PPI) and defective ribosomal product of the insulin gene (INS-DRIP). Clinical parameters were collected retrospectively. Results: Of 80 individuals, 67 had proliferation responses to one or more islet antigens, with vast differences in the extent of proliferation. Based on the multitude and amplitude of the proliferation responses, individuals were clustered into non-, intermediate and high responders. High responders could not be characterised entirely by enrichment for the highest risk HLA-DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 genotype. However, high responders did have a significantly higher non-HLA GRS. Clinically, high T cell responses to beta cell antigens did not reflect in worsened glycaemic control, increased complications, development of associated autoimmunity or younger age at disease onset. The number of beta cell antigens that an individual responded to increased with disease duration, pointing to chronic islet autoimmunity and epitope spreading. Conclusions/interpretation: Collectively, these data provide new insights into type 1 diabetes disease heterogeneity and highlight the importance of stratifying patients on the basis of their genetic and autoimmune signatures for immunotherapy and personalised disease management. © 2019, The Author(s).","Autoimmune disease; Autoreactive T cells; Disease endotypes; Disease heterogeneity; Epitope spreading; Immunotherapy; Islet autoantigen; Patient heterogeneity; Personalised medicine; Precision medicine","Adolescent; Adult; Autoimmunity; Cell Proliferation; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Genotype; HLA-DQ Antigens; HLA-DR Antigens; Humans; Insulin; Male; Principal Component Analysis; Protein Precursors; Retrospective Studies; T-Lymphocytes; Young Adult; autoantigen; epidermal growth factor receptor 3; glutamate decarboxylase 65; hemoglobin A1c; HLA DQ antigen; HLA DQ2 antigen; HLA DQ8 antigen; HLA DR antigen; HLA DR3 antigen; HLA DR4 antigen; insulin; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; islet antigen 2; non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 22; preproinsulin; unclassified drug; HLA DQ antigen; HLA DQ8 antigen; HLA DR antigen; insulin; preproinsulin; protein precursor; adolescent; Article; autoimmunity; cell proliferation; clinical research; cross-sectional study; disease duration; female; gene; genetic risk; genetic risk score; genotype; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; male; pancreas islet; pancreas islet beta cell; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; personalized medicine; priority journal; retrospective study; SH2B3 gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; adult; child; genetics; immunology; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; physiology; preschool child; principal component analysis; T lymphocyte; young adult","","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075313772"

The purpose of this study is to review the various techniques and clinical management paradigms using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to treat severe frostbite injuries, which are relevant to the interventional radiologist. Materials and Methods. A literature search yielded 157 citations, which were manually screened for inclusion criteria of case reports, case series, cohort studies, and randomized prospective studies that reported the use of tPA to treat severe frostbite injuries, of which 16 qualified for review. Data extracted from the studies included authors, journal, year of publication, initial assessment and management of severe frostbite injuries, inclusion and exclusion criteria for tPA therapy, treatment and control group size, different imaging modalities used in evaluation of severe frostbite injuries, tPA treatment protocols, outcomes, and side effects or complications. Results. The analyzed series included 209 patients with 1109 digits at risk of amputation who were treated with intraarterial (IA) or IV tPA (116 and 77 patients, respectively). A total of 926 digits at risk were treated with IA tPA and resulted in amputation of 222 digits, for a salvage rate of 76%. Twenty-four of 63 patients underwent amputation after IV tPA, resulting in a salvage rate of 62%. Both digital subtraction angiography and triple-phase bone scan were used for initial imaging evaluation. Additional concurrent treatment included therapeutic heparin, warfarin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, pain management, and light dressings with topical antimicrobial agents. Conclusion. Severe frostbite injuries can lead to devastating outcomes with loss of limbs and digits, yet clinical management continues to consist primarily of tissue rewarming, prolonged watchful waiting, and often delayed amputation. Recent studies have shown promising results using both IA and IV tPA to reduce amputation after severe frostbite injuries. Through a meta-analysis of thrombolytic therapy in the management of severe frostbite, this article provides a useful guideline for interventional radiologists including a suggested protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and potential complications. © 2020 American Roentgen Ray Society.","Frostbite; Thrombolytic; Tissue plasminogen activator","Fibrinolytic Agents; Frostbite; Humans; Radiography, Interventional; Thrombolytic Therapy; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; heparin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; tissue plasminogen activator; warfarin; fibrinolytic agent; tissue plasminogen activator; amputation; analgesia; antibiotic therapy; Article; bone scintiscanning; clinical practice; clinical protocol; digital subtraction angiography; disease severity; fibrinolytic therapy; frostbite; human; international normalized ratio; interventional radiologist; meta analysis; practice guideline; priority journal; risk assessment; systematic review; treatment outcome; treatment planning; treatment response; warming; diagnostic imaging; fibrinolytic therapy; frostbite; interventional radiology; procedures","","American Roentgen Ray Society","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082100297"

Endovascular thrombectomy is safe and effective in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation. This meta-analysis aims to investigate whether there is an interaction between atrial fibrillation and treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy, and secondarily whether atrial fibrillation is associated with worse outcome in patients with ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. Methods: Individual patient data were from six of the recent randomised clinical trials (MR CLEAN, EXTEND-IA, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, ESCAPE, PISTE) in which endovascular thrombectomy plus standard care was compared to standard care alone. Primary outcome measure was the shift on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were functional independence (mRS 0–2) at 90 days, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 h, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality at 90 days. The primary effect parameter was the adjusted common odds ratio, estimated with ordinal logistic regression (shift analysis); treatment effect modification of atrial fibrillation was assessed with a multiplicative interaction term. Results: Among 1351 patients, 447 patients had atrial fibrillation, 224 of whom were treated with endovascular thrombectomy. We found no interaction of atrial fibrillation with treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy for both primary (p-value for interaction: 0.58) and secondary outcomes. Regardless of treatment allocation, we found no difference in primary outcome (mRS at 90 days: aOR 1.11 (95% CI 0.89–1.38) and secondary outcomes between patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Conclusion: We found no interaction of atrial fibrillation on treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy, and no difference in outcome between large vessel occlusion stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation. © European Stroke Organisation 2020.","atrial fibrillation; endovascular thrombectomy; Ischemic stroke; large vessel occlusion","adult; artery occlusion; Article; atrial fibrillation; blood vessel occlusion; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; female; Functional Independence Measure; human; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; mortality; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; percutaneous thrombectomy; priority journal; Rankin scale; telephone interview","","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084529409"

All subjects underwent comprehensive staging surgery and were diagnosed as stages IA-IIA, grade 1-2. A total of 2644 patients were enrolled in the present study, among which 1589 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy. Comparisons of categorical data were performed via χ2 tests. Variables with P < 0.05 in univariate analyses were further analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Selection bias from the heterogeneity of demographic and clinical characteristics was avoided using propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), investigating the association between variables and 5-year overall survival. After the propensity score matching, there was an equal number of patients with or without chemotherapy (n = 925). The results of the present study indicated that those aged ≥65 years were at an increased risk of ovarian cancer, and the age was associated with poor prognosis (HR, 1.486; CI, 1.208-1.827; P < 0.001). Endometrioid carcinoma was associated with improved 5-year overall survival compared with serous cystadenocarcinoma (HR, 0.697; CI, 0.584-0.833; P < 0.001). Chemotherapy could not prolong the 5-year overall survival of patients with early-stage serous and endometrioid ovarian cancer (HR, 1.092; CI, 0.954-1.249; P = 0.201). These results demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy was unnecessary for patients with early-stage serous and endometrioid ovarian cancer after they underwent comprehensive staging surgery. © 2020 The Author(s).","Chemotherapy; Endometrioid; Ovarian cancer; Overall survival; Serous","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Carboplatin; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Ovarian Neoplasms; Paclitaxel; Prognosis; Propensity Score; SEER Program; Survival Analysis; carboplatin; paclitaxel; carboplatin; paclitaxel; adult; age; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; case control study; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; cystadenocarcinoma; demography; disease association; endometrioid carcinoma; follow up; gynecologic oncologist; human; major clinical study; multiple cycle treatment; overall survival; priority journal; adjuvant chemotherapy; cancer registry; cancer staging; comparative study; cystadenocarcinoma; endometrioid carcinoma; female; middle aged; ovary tumor; pathology; prognosis; propensity score; statistical model; survival analysis","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089324629"

The Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft platform (Endologix, Irving, Calif) contains a polymer-filled proximal sealing ring and has a low-profile delivery system, potentially beneficial in female patients. We therefore investigated differences in long-term outcomes between men and women treated with this device. Methods: We used data collected prospectively in the Effectiveness of Custom Seal with Ovation: Review of the Evidence (ENCORE) database, comprising five trials and the European Post-Market Registry. Anatomic characteristics of the proximal aneurysm neck and iliac arteries were compared between male and female patients. Outcomes were 5-year freedom from type IA and type I/III endoleaks, abdominal aortic aneurysm-related reinterventions, and overall survival. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate survival proportions and tested univariate differences in survival using log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to adjust for baseline differences. Results: We identified 1045 (81%) male and 251 (19%) female patients undergoing EVAR. Female patients were older (mean age, 75 ± 8.4 years vs 73 ± 8.1 years; P <.006). Aneurysm diameter (52 ± 7.5 mm vs 55 ± 9.2 mm; P <.001) and proximal neck diameter (21 ± 3.3 mm vs 23 ± 2.9 mm; P <.001) were smaller in female patients, but adjusted for body surface area, female patients had relatively larger aneurysms and aneurysm necks. Furthermore, female patients presented with shorter proximal necks, smaller iliac artery diameters, more angulated necks, and higher rates of reverse-tapered necks. Five-year freedom from type IA endoleak was similar between men and women (97% vs 96%; P =.38), as was freedom from type I/III endoleaks (91% vs 94%; P =.37) and reinterventions (91% vs 93%; P =.67). Five-year survival was 81% for female patients, similar to the 79% in male patients (P =.55), with one aneurysm-related death in female patients (0.4%) and five in male patients (0.8%; P =.76). Risk-adjusted analyses showed no association between sex and type IA endoleak (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-3.1; P =.41), type I/III endoleak (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.7-2.8; P =.33), reintervention (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-2.0; P =.77), and overall mortality (HR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1; P =.14). Conclusions: Female patients undergoing EVAR with the Ovation platform presented with substantially more adverse proximal neck characteristics.

Recent evidence supports the replacement of IA with well-tolerated oral bedaquiline (BDQ) and a shortened 9-12 month regimen. DESIGN: Using a Markov model, we analyzed the 5- year budgetary impact and cost per successful treatment outcome of four regimens: 1) IA long-course, 2) oral long-course, 3) IA short-course, and 4) oral short-course. We used the South African MDR/RR-TB case register (2013-2015) to assess treatment outcomes for the thenstandard IA long-course. Data on the improvement in outcomes for BDQ-based regimens were based on the literature. Costs were estimated from the provider perspective using costs incurred to provide decentralized treatment for MDR-TB at a Johannesburg hospital. RESULT S : Based on our analysis, by 2023, the cost/ successful outcome for the four regimens was respectively 1) US$7374, 2) US$7860, 3) US$5149, and 4) US$4922. The annual total cost of each regimen was US$37 million, US$43 million, US$26 million, and US$28 million. CONCLUS ION: Despite the high cost of BDQ, a BDQbased shortened regimen for the treatment of MDR/RRTB will result in improved treatment outcomes and cost savings for South Africa. © 2020 The Union.","Bedaquiline; Cost; Cost-effectiveness; MDR-TB; TB","Antitubercular Agents; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Care Costs; Humans; South Africa; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; aminoglycoside; bedaquiline; rifampicin; tuberculostatic agent; adult; Article; budget; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; drug cost; drug tolerability; female; health care cost; hospital; human; injection; major clinical study; Markov chain; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; ototoxicity; patient care; priority journal; rifampicin resistance; South Africa; treatment duration; treatment failure; treatment outcome; cost benefit analysis","","International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083872346"

Chorioamnionitis can be either acute or chronic and is associated with adverse postnatal outcomes of the intestine, including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Neonates with NEC have structural and functional damage to the intestinal mucosa and the enteric nervous system (ENS), with loss of enteric neurons and glial cells. Yet, the impact of acute, chronic, or repetitive antenatal inflammatory stimuli on the development of the intestinal mucosa and ENS has not been studied. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of acute, chronic, and repetitive microbial exposure on the intestinal mucosa, submucosa and ENS in premature lambs. Materials and Methods: A sheep model of pregnancy was used in which the ileal mucosa, submucosa, and ENS were assessed following IA exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 or 7 days (acute), Ureaplasma parvum (UP) for 42 days (chronic), or repetitive microbial exposure (42 days UP with 2 or 7 days LPS). Results: IA LPS exposure for 7 days or IA UP exposure for 42 days caused intestinal injury and inflammation in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the gut. Repetitive microbial exposure did not further aggravate injury of the terminal ileum. Chronic IA UP exposure caused significant structural ENS alterations characterized by loss of PGP9.5 and S100β immunoreactivity, whereas these changes were not found after re-exposure of chronic UP-exposed fetuses to LPS for 2 or 7 days. Conclusion: The in utero loss of PGP9.5 and S100β immunoreactivity following chronic UP exposure corresponds with intestinal changes in neonates with NEC and may therefore form a novel mechanistic explanation for the association of chorioamnionitis and NEC. © Copyright © 2020 Heymans, de Lange, Hütten, Lenaerts, de Ruijter, Kessels, Rademakers, Melotte, Boesmans, Saito, Usuda, Stock, Spiller, Payne, Kramer, Newnham, Jobe, Kemp, van Gemert and Wolfs.","chorioamnionitis; enteric nervous system; intra-amniotic infection; necrotizing enterocolitis; preterm birth; sheep; Ureaplasma parvum","Animals; Animals, Newborn; Chorioamnionitis; Chronic Disease; Disease Models, Animal; Enteric Nervous System; Enterocolitis, Necrotizing; Female; Fetus; Intestinal Mucosa; Lipopolysaccharides; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit; Sheep; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Ureaplasma; Ureaplasma Infections; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; tumor necrosis factor; lipopolysaccharide; protein S100B; ubiquitin thiolesterase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell count; cell infiltration; cesarean section; controlled study; data analysis; enteritis; female; gene expression; histology; immunohistochemistry; intestine injury; intestine mucosa; long term exposure; necrotizing enterocolitis; nervous system; neutrophil; nonhuman; pregnancy; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; scoring system; surface area; Ureaplasma infection; Ureaplasma parvum; animal; chorioamnionitis; chronic disease; complication; disease model; drug effect; embryology; fetus; injury; intestine innervation; metabolism; microbiology; newborn; prematurity; sheep; Ureaplasma; Ureaplasma infection; veterinary medicine","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082686403"

However, interference is one of the critical challenges in MIMO-OFDM systems that degrades the overall performance. In this study, a novel interference alignment (IA) design-based diagonal-block channel charter to mitigate the interference for MIMO-OFDM systems is proposed. The proposed IA scheme can be used in physical layer security, e.g. anti-location. Based on the diagonal-block charter of the channel matrix, the optimal degree of freedom, i.e. The maximum number of multiple data streams concurrently transmitted interference-free can be achieved by IA. Correspondingly, the authors present the closed-form IA design scheme for some special scenarios, and two iterative IA ones for general scenarios in detail. Furthermore, the performance analysis of IA systems with diagonal-block channel error is provided, where the imperfect channel state information case is considered. The simulation results show that the IA design based on the diagonal-block channel can improve the sum-rate performance effectively, by sufficiently exploiting the spatial and frequency resources. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","","Data streams; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Gain control; MIMO systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio broadcasting; Critical challenges; Frequency resources; Imperfect channel state information; Interference alignment; Interference-free; Multiple data streams; Performance analysis; Physical layer security; Channel state information","","Institution of Engineering and Technology","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086429785"

Objective: To determine the factors predicting the cost of readmission episodes following elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Methods: We queried the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmissions Database for patients undergoing elective ACDF during 2012 to 2015. Multivariable linear regression was performed to establish the factors associated with the cost of each 30-/90-d readmission episode. Results: A total of 139 877 and 113 418 patientsmet inclusion criteria for the evaluation of 30- and 90-d readmissions, respectively. Among these, the national rates of 30- and 90-d readmission after an elective ACDF were 3% and 6%, respectively. The median cost of a 30- and 90-d readmission episode was $6727 (IQR: $3844-$13 529) and $8507 (IQR: $4567- $17 460), respectively. Relative predictor importance analysis revealed that the number of procedures at index admission (IA), length of stay at IA, and time elapsed between index surgical admission and readmission were the top predictors of both 30- and 90-d readmission costs (all P < .001). Although cervical myelopathy accounted for only 3.6% of all 30-d readmissions, it accounted for the largest share (8%) of 30-d readmission costs. Conclusion: In this analysis from a national all-payer database, we determined the factors associated with the cost of readmissions following elective ACDF. These results are important in assisting policymakers and payers with a better risk adjustment in bundled care payment systems and for surgeons in implementing readmission cost-reduction efforts.

The aim of the LUCY study is to explore the comparative safety and effectiveness of EVAR using a low-profile stent graft (Ovation; Endologix, Inc, Irvine, Calif) in females as well as males. Methods: The LUCY registry was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study where patient enrollment was stratified by sex in a two-to-one ratio (male-to-female). Main outcomes were procedural data, 30-day major adverse events, device-related adverse events confirmed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, secondary interventions, and hospital readmissions. Adverse events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee. Patients were followed at their 1-month and 1-year follow-up visits. Results: A total of 225 patients (76 females, 149 males) were enrolled at 39 U.S. centers. No statistically significant sex differences were observed in demographics or medical history. Females presented with smaller access vessels (6.2 vs 7.7 mm; P <.001), statistically smaller neck diameter (22 mm vs 23 mm; P =.001), similar neck angulation (11% vs 9% angulation >45°; P =.81), and smaller maximum abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter (50 mm vs 53 mm; P =.01), however, these factors do not seem to be clinically significant. Technical success was 99%, and the median hospital stay was 1 day. The incidence of MAE through 30 days was 1.3% in females and 2.0% in males. There were no differences between sexes observed among the 30-day perioperative outcomes. The 30-day secondary intervention rate was 0.4%. The all-cause readmission rate through 30 days was 5.3% in females and 6.7% in males. There were no reports of limb occlusion or deaths within the first 30 days. At 1 year, there were no deaths in the female arm but nine deaths (6.0%) were observed in males, two of which were AAA related (1.3%). Through 1 year, there were eight type IA endoleaks (one female, seven males; P =.27) and three cases with limb occlusion (one female, two males). There were no reports of migration, AAA rupture, or surgical conversion through the end of follow-up. Conclusions: Despite more complex aortic morphology in females than males, EVAR with a low-profile stent graft was associated with comparable procedural and perioperative outcomes through 1 year between the sexes. © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery","Abdominal aortic aneurysm; Endovascular; EVAR; Female sex","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Readmission; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Prosthesis Design; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States; politef; abdominal aorta; abdominal aortic aneurysm; adult; aged; all cause mortality; aneurysm diameter; Article; bleeding; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; controlled study; demography; endoleak; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; femoral artery; follow up; heart infarction; hospital readmission; human; iliac artery; incidence; length of stay; limb disease; limb occlusion; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; morphology; mortality; multicenter study; paralysis; patient safety; perioperative period; priority journal; prospective study; sepsis; sex difference; thrombectomy; United States; urinary tract infection; vascular access; very elderly; abdominal aortic aneurysm; adverse event; blood vessel prosthesis; blood vessel transplantation; clinical trial; comparative study; devices; diagnostic imaging; endovascular surgery; health disparity; postoperative complication; prosthesis design; risk assessment; risk factor; sex factor; stent; time factor; treatment outcome","","Mosby Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077544859"

Methods: Data were collected from the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2014. Based on demographic and surgical characteristics, a novel 10-year survival prognostic scoring system was developed using Cox regression. Results: There were 2041 eligible patients with stage I mucinous ovarian cancer including 1362 (67%) with stage IA/IB disease, 598 (29%) with stage IC disease, and 81 (4%) with stage I disease not otherwise specified. Median age was 52 with a range of 13–90 years old. 737 (36%) patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was more common in patients with stage IC relative to stage IA/IB disease (69% vs. 21%, P < 0.001) or with poorly-differentiated relative to well-differentiated tumors (69% vs. 23%, P < 0.001). Unadjusted 10-year survival was 81% relative to 79% for patients treated with vs. without chemotherapy, respectively (P = 0.46). Patients were predicted to exhibit a low- or a high-risk of death using a multivariate Cox regression model with age, stage, grade, lymphovascular space invasion and ascites. Risk of death without vs. with adjuvant chemotherapy was similar in low-risk patients (88% vs. 84%; HR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.56–1.15, P = 0.23) and worse in high-risk patients (51% vs. 74%; HR = 1.58, 95%CI: 1.05–2.38, P = 0.03) with stage I mucinous ovarian cancer. Conclusions: A predictive scoring algorithm may provide prognostic information on long-term survival and identify high-risk stage I mucinous ovarian cancer patients who might achieve a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Chemotherapy; Clinical calculator; Mucinous ovarian cancer","Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Clinical Decision-Making; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Nomograms; Ovarian Neoplasms; Ovary; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Salpingo-oophorectomy; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; United States; Young Adult; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adolescent; adult; African American; aged; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; Asian; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer survival; Caucasian; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical feature; cohort analysis; female; high risk patient; human; hysterectomy; long term survival; low risk patient; lymph node dissection; lymph vessel metastasis; machine learning; major clinical study; malignant ascites; observational study; omentectomy; ovary cancer; overall survival; Pacific Islander; priority journal; retrospective study; salpingooophorectomy; adjuvant chemotherapy; algorithm; clinical decision making; colloid carcinoma; decision support system; epidemiology; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; mortality; nomogram; ovary; ovary tumor; pathology; procedures; register; risk assessment; surgery; survival rate; treatment outcome; United States; very elderly; young adult","","Academic Press Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089557956"

However, in a large sample, there is little research on the association between IA and insomnia in Chinese college students. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of insomnia and its related risk factors among Chinese college students with IA. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate 627 Chinese college students with IA. Each student completed a survey on demographic data, Internet addiction (Revised Chinese Internet Addiction Scale), depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale), anxiety (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), and suicidal behavior. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to adjust for confounding factors. Results: The prevalence of insomnia among students with IA was 54.86%. Compared with IA students without insomnia, IA students with insomnia were more likely to be younger, smoking, drinking, have anxiety, depression, suicidal ideations, suicide plans, and suicide attempts (all p < 0.05). Moreover, drinking [OR, 1.664; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.139–2.431; p = 0.008], anxiety (OR, 2.321; 95% CI, 1.116–4.826; p = 0.024), and suicidal ideation (OR, 1.942; 95% CI:1.295–2.911; p = 0.001) were independently associated with insomnia in IA students. Conclusions: Insomnia is very common in Chinese IA students. Drinking, anxiety, and suicidal ideation are independently correlated with insomnia.

The new quality improvement project of the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (IAC) may satisfy an improvement activity (IA) of the MACRA. We hypothesize that other IAs in the MACRA such as timeliness of test results or patient care quality performance requirements can be met by analyzing data already being collected by the vascular laboratory. After a process improvement strategy, we chose to review progress in our vascular laboratory related to time to interpretation (TI), patient check-in to study completion (study time), wait time for first available outpatient venous duplex scan (wait time), technologist productivity, and critical results reporting. Methods: Data from our hospital-based vascular laboratory were collected from 2010 to 2016. TI was collected through our reporting software VascuPro (Consensus Medical), and study time and wait time were obtained from electronic medical records (EMR) (Epic). Technologist productivity was calculated by commercially available productivity tools, and compliance with critical results reporting was calculated quarterly as per our quality assurance program. Appropriateness of carotid duplex scan testing was performed by expert review of International Classification of Disease codes used to request the test. Results: TI analysis comprised 91,352 studies with a mean of 3.3 hr between test completion and final interpretation. The TI improved from 5.0 to 2.1 hr on weekdays and was longer on weekends (4.9 hr; P < 0.001). The study time improved from 29.8 to 27.2 min and was 14.9 min shorter on the weekends (P < 0.001). The wait time ranged from a mean of 1–2.08 days. Technologist productivity improved from 90.7% to 93.6%. Critical results reporting quarterly audits showed a 100% compliance rate. On expert review, the International Classification of Disease code on carotid duplex scan requests in the EMR was deemed inaccurate in 17.4% of cases. Conclusions: TI and study time improved; wait time and critical results reporting remained steady. Most of the data are readily available in a vascular laboratory standard EMR. The plan–do–study–act (PDSA or Shewhart Cycle) principle is critical to process improvement and needed as we transition from traditional accreditation mostly based on test accuracy to one demanding efficiency, timeliness, patient satisfaction, productivity, accountability, and appropriateness of testing. Process improvement studies will improve patient care and satisfaction, increase efficiency and throughput, while satisfying changing IAC standards and preparing for upcoming regulatory requirements of the MACRA. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","","Accreditation; Appointments and Schedules; Carotid Arteries; Clinical Laboratory Services; Efficiency; Humans; Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015; Policy Making; Quality Improvement; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex; United States; Workflow; accreditation; Article; carotid artery; clinical audit; echography; electronic medical record; human; International Classification of Diseases; laboratory; measurement accuracy; outpatient; patient care; patient satisfaction; priority journal; productivity; reimbursement; retrospective study; vascular laboratory; clinical laboratory service; diagnostic imaging; duplex Doppler ultrasonography; economics; health care quality; hospital management; management; medicare; time factor; total quality management; United States; workflow","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079044322"

However, the immunological role of PI3K-δ isoform is still controversial in airway epithelium under house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic response. This study aimed to evaluate the role of PI3K-δ isoform in HDM-induced allergic responses, focusing on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in airway epithelium. Methods: We used wild-type mice and PI3K-δ knock-out (KO) mice for HDM-induced asthma animal model and also performed in vitro experiments using primary cultured murine tracheal epithelial cells and human airway epithelial cells. Results: PI3K-δ activated HDM-induced NLRP3 inflammasome and epithelial cell-derived cytokines in the lung including airway epithelial cells. PI3K-δ KO mice or knock-down of PI3K-δ using siRNA exhibited the significant reduction in allergic asthmatic features and the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly as well as epithelial cell-derived cytokines. Interestingly, significantly increased expression of PI3K-δ isoform was observed in stimulated airway epithelial cells and the increases in epithelial cell-derived cytokines were markedly suppressed by blocking PI3K-δ, while these cytokine levels were independent of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that PI3K-δ-isoform can promote HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent response as well as via NLRP3 inflammasome-independent epithelial cell activation.  © 2020 The Korean Academy of Asthma.","Asthma; Epithelial cell; House dust mite; Inflammasomes; Kinases","2 (6 amino 9 purinylmethyl) 5 methyl 3 (2 methylphenyl) 3h quinazolin 4 one; cell protein; cryopyrin; der p1 protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inflammasome; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 25; interleukin 33; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; mcc 950; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase delta; protein inhibitor; protein kinase B; protein p110; protein p110delta; protein p85; reactive oxygen metabolite; resatorvid; small interfering RNA; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; airway epithelium cell; allergic asthma; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; bronchus epithelium; controlled study; cytokine production; data analysis software; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; enzyme activity; female; gene knockdown; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammatory cell; lung lavage; lung parenchyma; mitochondrion; mouse; nonhuman; Pi3K/Akt signaling; primary culture; protein expression level; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; Th2 cell; trachea epithelium; upregulation","","Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082684615"

To determine the association of NLNs with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with stage IA NSCLC with tumor size ≤ 2 cm who underwent different lung surgeries. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 7293 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Median NLNs was used to classify the patients into two groups: group A with NLNs ≤ 5 and group B with NLNs > 5. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to decrease selection bias. Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to identify the association between NLNs and survival outcomes. Results: Group B had better survival than group A in the unmatched cohort and matched cohort (all P < 0.05). Multivariable analyses revealed that the NLNs significantly affected CSS and OS of eligible cases in the unmatched cohort and matched cohort. Additionally, we found that the NLNs was a protective prognostic predictor of OS for patients who underwent wedge resection, segmental resection, or lobectomy. Conclusion: The NLNs was a protective prognostic factor in NSCLC patients with tumor size ≤ 2 cm. We demonstrated that patients with > 5 NLNs in the cohort of wedge resection, segmental resection, or lobectomy exhibited a significantly better OS. © 2020, The Author(s).","Lymph nodes; Non-small cell lung cancer; Prognosis; Small tumor size; Surgery","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lymph Nodes; Neoplasm Staging; Pneumonectomy; Prognosis; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; antineoplastic agent; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer size; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; data base; disease association; female; human; human tissue; lung lobectomy; lung surgery; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; patient coding; propensity score; retrospective study; segmentectomy; wedge resection; cancer staging; lung resection; lung tumor; lymph node; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; prognosis","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097250174"

Given the cost implications of a nationwide programme, local economic evaluation data are needed to inform policy on the design and benefits of influenza vaccination. We set out to estimate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in Kenya. Methods: We fitted an age-stratified dynamic transmission model to active surveillance data from patients with influenza from 2010 to 2018. Using a societal perspective, we developed a decision tree cost-effectiveness model and estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for three vaccine target groups: children 6-23 months (strategy I), 2-5 years (strategy II) and 6-14 years (strategy III) with either the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (Strategy A) or Northern Hemisphere vaccine (Strategy B) or both (Strategy C: twice yearly vaccination campaigns, or Strategy D: year-round vaccination campaigns). We assessed cost-effectiveness by calculating incremental net monetary benefits (INMB) using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 1-51% of the annual gross domestic product per capita ($17-$872). Results: The mean number of infections across all ages was 2-15 million per year. When vaccination was well timed to influenza activity, the annual mean ICER per DALY averted for vaccinating children 6-23 months ranged between $749 and $1385 for strategy IA, $442 and $1877 for strategy IB, $678 and $4106 for strategy IC and $1147 and $7933 for strategy ID. For children 2-5 years, it ranged between $945 and $1573 for strategy IIA, $563 and $1869 for strategy IIB, $662 and $4085 for strategy IIC, and $1169 and $7897 for strategy IID. For children 6-14 years, it ranged between $923 and $3116 for strategy IIIA, $1005 and $2223 for strategy IIIB, $883 and $4727 for strategy IIIC and $1467 and $6813 for strategy IIID. Overall, no vaccination strategy was cost-effective at the minimum ($17) and median ($445) WTP thresholds. Vaccinating children 6-23 months once a year had the highest mean INMB value at $872 (WTP threshold upper limit); however, this strategy had very low probability of the highest net benefit. Conclusion: Vaccinating children 6-23 months once a year was the most favourable vaccination option; however, the strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective given the current WTP thresholds. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cost-effectiveness; Dynamic transmission model; Economic evaluation; Influenza vaccine; Low- and middle-income countries; Vaccine target group; Vaccine timing","Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Female; Humans; Infant; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Kenya; Male; influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; adolescent; Article; child; cost effectiveness analysis; cost of illness; disability-adjusted life year; gross national product; health care cost; human; immunoprophylaxis; infant; infection prevention; influenza vaccination; Kenya; preschool child; probability; seasonal influenza; cost benefit analysis; disease transmission; economics; female; influenza; male; prevention and control","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089714353"

In this paper, intervals are used to describe the uncertainties of distribution parameters of the random variables, and an interval probabilistic energy flow (IPEF) calculation model of the CCHP campus microgrid is established. Introducing the interval arithmetic (IA) into the cumulant method, an IA-based IPEF algorithm is proposed to obtain the analytical expressions of probability density function or cumulative distribution function intervals of the state variables. Moreover, affine arithmetic (AA) is introduced to address the interval extension problem in the calculation, and an AAIA-based IPEF algorithm is proposed. By constructing the correlation transformation matrixes, the correlation among different node power is considered in the IPEF calculation. A case study on a CCHP campus microgrid demonstrates that the results of the AAIA-based IPEF algorithm are more accurate than those of the IA-based IPEF algorithm by using the results of the double-layer Monte Carlo method as a reference. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are more efficient than the double-layer Monte Carlo method.  © 2013 IEEE.","affine arithmetic; CCHP campus micro-grid; correlation; cumulant method; higher-order uncertainty; interval arithmetic; interval probabilistic energy flow calculation","Distribution functions; Instrument errors; Microgrids; Monte Carlo methods; Random errors; Random variables; Uncertainty analysis; Analytical expressions; Combined cooling heating and power; Correlation transformation; Cumulative distribution function; Distribution parameters; Interval arithmetic; Interval uncertainty; Measurement instruments; Probability density function","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089872644"

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Internalized AIDS-Related Stigma Scale (IA-RSS). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the six-item IA-RSS was conducted using data from four cross-sectional surveys implemented in Cambodia (n = 1207), the Dominican Republic (n = 891), Uganda (n = 391) and Tanzania (n = 529) between 2018 and 2019. METHODS: IA-RSS scale item distribution was described. Multivariate regression models measured correlations between the IA-RSS and depression, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and viral suppression. Confirmatory factor analysis assessed IA-RSS reliability and performance through analysis of standardized factor loadings and conditional probabilities of scale items. Analysis of qualitative interviews with PLHIV explored acceptability of IA-RSS item content. RESULTS: Mean IA-RSS scores (possible 0-6) ranged from 2.06 (Uganda) to 3.84 (Cambodia), and internal consistency was more than 0.70 in each country (Kuder-Richardson 20), ranging from 0.71 to 0.83. Higher IA-RSS scores were strongly correlated with depression in (P < 0.001 in all countries), and inversely associated with current ART use (Dominican Republic and Tanzania) and self-reported viral suppression (Uganda and Tanzania). Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit (all CFI ≥ 0.950), but also that the IA-RSS may summarize two domains related to HIV status disclosure (two items) and PLHIV feelings about themselves (four items). CONCLUSION: Strong performance across countries supports continued use of the IA-RSS. Further study is needed to explore potential item refinements and to better understand the relationship between internalized stigma and HIV treatment outcomes.","","Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Cambodia; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dominican Republic; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Social Discrimination; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tanzania; Uganda; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; Cambodia; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; Dominican Republic; female; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; social discrimination; social stigma; Tanzania; Uganda","","NLM (Medline)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090321039"

However, it remains unclear how meditation impacts internal attention (IA) states due to lack of measurement tools that can objectively assess mental states during meditation practice itself, and produce time estimates of internal focus at individual or group levels. To address these measurement gaps, we tested the feasibility of applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to single-subject fMRI data to: (1) learn and recognize internal attentional states relevant for meditation during a directed IA task; and (2) decode or estimate the presence of those IA states during an independent meditation session. Within a mixed sample of experienced meditators and novice controls (N = 16), we first used MVPA to develop single-subject brain classifiers for five modes of attention during an IA task in which subjects were specifically instructed to engage in one of five states [i.e., meditation-related states: breath attention, mind wandering (MW), and self-referential processing, and control states: attention to feet and sounds]. Using standard cross-validation procedures, MVPA classifiers were trained in five of six IA blocks for each subject, and predictive accuracy was tested on the independent sixth block (iterated until all volumes were tested, N = 2,160). Across participants, all five IA states were significantly recognized well above chance (>41% vs. 20% chance). At the individual level, IA states were recognized in most participants (87.5%), suggesting that recognition of IA neural patterns may be generalizable for most participants, particularly experienced meditators. Next, for those who showed accurate IA neural patterns, the originally trained classifiers were applied to a separate meditation run (10-min) to make an inference about the percentage time engaged in each IA state (breath attention, MW, or self-referential processing). Preliminary group-level analyses demonstrated that during meditation practice, participants spent more time attending to breath compared to MW or self-referential processing. This paradigm established the feasibility of using MVPA classifiers to objectively assess mental states during meditation at the participant level, which holds promise for improved measurement of internal attention states cultivated by meditation. © Copyright © 2020 Weng, Lewis-Peacock, Hecht, Uncapher, Ziegler, Farb, Goldman, Skinner, Duncan, Chao and Gazzaley.","attention; interoception; meditation; mind wandering; multivoxel pattern analysis; self-referential processing","adult; article; attention; brain; breathing; classifier; controlled study; cross validation; feasibility study; female; foot; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human cell; human experiment; interoception; major clinical study; male; meditation; mental health; mind wandering; sound; validation process","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090861322"

We simulate 1000 GW standard siren data based on a 10-year observation of the ET to make this analysis. We find that all the cosmological parameters in the HDE model can be tremendously improved by including the GW standard siren data in the cosmological fit. The GW data combined with the current cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data will measure the cosmological parameters Ω m, H, and c in the HDE model to be at the accuracies of 1.28%, 0.59%, and 3.69%, respectively. A comparison with the cosmological constant model and the constant-w dark energy model shows that, compared to the standard model, the parameter degeneracies will be broken more thoroughly in a dynamical dark energy model. We find that the GW data alone can provide a fairly good measurement for H, but for other cosmological parameters the GW data alone can only provide rather weak measurements. However, due to the fact that the parameter degeneracies can be broken by the GW data, the standard sirens can play an essential role in improving the parameter estimation. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","","Springer","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081284853"

Methods: The clinical and genotypic data of 49 patients with hepatic GSDs were collected retrospectively and analyzed. Results: After gene sequencing, 49 patients were diagnosed as GSDs, including GSD Ia (24 cases), GSD IIIa (11 cases), GSD IXa (8 cases), GSD VI (3 cases) and GSD Ib (3 cases). About 45 gene variants of G6PC, AGL, PHKA2, PYGL, and SLC37A4 were detected; among which, 22 variants were unreported previously. c.648G>T (p. Leu216Leu) of G6PC exon 5 is the most common variant for GSD Ia patients (20/24,83.33%）, splice variant c.1735+1G>T of AGL exon 13 is relatively common among GSD IIIa, while novel variant accounts for the majority of GSD IXa and GSD VI patients. As for clinical features, there was no significant difference in the onset age among group GSD Ia, GSD IIIa, and GSD IXa, but the age at diagnosis and average disease duration from diagnosis of GSD Ia were significantly higher than GSD IIIa and GSD IXa. Body weight of GSD patients was basically normal, but growth retardation was relatively common among them, especially for GSD Ia patients; and renomegaly was only found in GSD Ia. Besides, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, lactic acid, and uric acid in GSD Ia were significantly higher than those with GSD IIIa and IXa (p < 0.05); but ALT, AST, CK, and LDH of GSD III and GSD IXa were significantly higher when compared to GSD Ia (p < 0.05). Conclusions: All hepatic GSDs patients share similarity in clinical and biochemical spectrum, but delayed diagnosis and biochemical metabolic abnormalities were common in GSD Ia. For family with GSD proband, pedigree analysis and genetic testing is strongly recommended. © 2020 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: From February 2011 to August 2018, 31 of 1,806 patients (1.7%) who underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with double PSGs (DPSGs) (n = 20) or triple PSGs (TPSGs) (n = 11) were retrospectively reviewed. Procedures were performed in high-risk patients who had TAA or AD involving zone 1 or zone 0. Results: Fifteen patients (48.4%) who presented with symptomatic or impending rupture underwent urgent or emergent TEVAR with DPSGs or TPSGs. Nineteen patients (61.3%) were treated for zone 0 disease. Technical and clinical success rates were 70.0% for DPSG cohort and 45.5% for TPSG cohort. Intraoperative type Ia endoleak was observed in 30% of DPSG cohort and 45.5% of TPSG cohort. One patient in the DPSG cohort died of aortic sinus rupture intraoperatively. Minor stroke during the 30-day postoperative period was more frequent in the TPSG cohort (P = .042). Mean duration of follow-up was 28.9 months ± 17.7. The TPSG cohort had a higher incidence of major adverse events (72.7% vs 25.0%, P = .021). The most common adverse events were endoleaks (12.9%), endograft migration (9.7%), PSG stenosis or occlusion (6.5%), retrograde dissection (6.5%), and stroke (3.2%). Endograft migrations were more common in TPSG cohort (27.3%, P = .037). Overall mortality rate was 16.1% (5/31) perioperatively and during follow-up. There were no statistical differences in overall survival and reintervention-free survival. Conclusions: In the context of TEVAR with multiple PSGs for aortic arch repair, TPSGs may have a high risk of major complications. © 2020 SIR","","Aged; Aneurysm, Dissecting; Aorta, Thoracic; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; adult; all cause mortality; aortic arch aneurysm; aortic arch surgery; aortic dissection; Article; ascending aorta surgery; ascending aortic aneurysm; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis software; endoleak; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; follow up; heart infarction; hemoptysis; human; in-stent restenosis; length of stay; male; middle aged; mortality rate; outcome assessment; overall survival; postoperative complication; priority journal; retrospective study; stent migration; surgical mortality; thoracic aorta aneurysm; treatment outcome; adverse event; aged; blood vessel prosthesis; blood vessel transplantation; comparative study; devices; diagnostic imaging; dissecting aneurysm; endovascular surgery; mortality; postoperative complication; risk assessment; risk factor; stent; thoracic aorta; thoracic aorta aneurysm; time factor; treatment outcome","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095726216"

Specifically, the role of LVSI as an independent risk factor for mortality in stage IA disease has not been shown. Objective We examined the association between LVSI and nodal metastases and survival for women with stage IA1 and IA2 cervical cancer. Study Design We used the National Cancer Database to identify patients with stage IA adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma of the cervix from January 2010 through December 2015 for whom LVSI status was known. Mixed-effect log-Poisson models were used to identify predictors of LVSI. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare all-cause mortality. Results We identified 3239 patients with stage IA1 and 1049 patients with stage IA2 carcinoma of the cervix. Among patients with stage IA1 and IA2 disease, 10.5% and 18.8% had LVSI, respectively. Less than 1% of patients with stage IA1 disease without LVSI had positive nodes compared with 7.8% of those with LVSI (p<0.001). Lymphatic metastases were identified in 1.7% of stage IA2 cases without LVSI versus 14.6% for those with LVSI (p<0.001). Among both stage IA1 and IA2 patients, squamous histology, grade 3 tumor differentiation, and white race were associated with LVSI (p<0.05 for all). In a univariable model, the hazard ratio for death associated with LVSI was 1.05 (95% CI 0.45 to 2.45) for women with stage IA1 tumors and 2.36 (95% CI 1.04 to 5.33) for those with IA2 neoplasms. Conclusions LVSI is associated with lymph node metastases in patients with stage IA cervical cancer. LVSI is associated with decreased survival for women with stage IA2 cervical cancer. © IGCS and ESGO 2020.","adenocarcinoma; cervical cancer; lymphatic metastasis","Adult; Aged; Carcinoma; Female; Humans; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; adenosquamous carcinoma; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; Caucasian; cohort analysis; controlled study; depth of invasion; female; histology; human; human tissue; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; middle aged; priority journal; radical hysterectomy; sensitivity analysis; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor differentiation; uterine cervix adenocarcinoma; uterine cervix cancer; carcinoma; epidemiology; lymph node; lymph node metastasis; mortality; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; United States; uterine cervix tumor","","BMJ Publishing Group","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082000811"

Autophagy can be regulated by several energy sensing pathways, including sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), forkhead box O (FoxO), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using 10-day old global G6pc-deficient (G6pc-/-) mice, hepatic autophagy impairment was attributed to activation of mTOR and inhibition of AMPK signaling. In other studies, using adult liver-specific G6pc-deficient mice at both pre-tumor and tumor stages, hepatic autophagy impairment was attributed to downregulation of SIRT1 signaling and mTOR was not implicated. In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of the major autophagy pathways in young G6pc-/- mice over the first 4 weeks of life. We show that impaired SIRT1, FoxO3a, AMPK, and PPAR-α signaling are responsible for autophagy impairment but mTOR is involved minimally. Hepatic SIRT1 overexpression corrects defective autophagy, restores the expression of FoxO3a and liver kinase B1 but fails to normalize impaired PPAR-α expression or metabolic abnormalities associated with GSD-Ia. Importantly, restoration of hepatic G6Pase-α expression in G6pc-/- mice corrects defective autophagy, restores SIRT1/FoxO3a/AMPK/PPAR-α signaling and rectifies metabolic abnormalities. Taken together, these data show that hepatic autophagy impairment in GSD-Ia is mediated by downregulation of SIRT1/FoxO3a/AMPK/PPAR-α signaling.  © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press 2020.","","Animals; Autophagy; Forkhead Box Protein O3; Glycogen Storage Disease Type I; Liver; Metabolome; Mice; PPAR alpha; Protein Kinases; Signal Transduction; Sirtuin 1; beclin 1; glucose 6 phosphatase; glycogen; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; lactic acid; mammalian target of rapamycin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; protein kinase LKB1; sirtuin 1; transcription factor FKHRL1; AMP-activated protein kinase kinase; FoxO3 protein, mouse; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; protein kinase; Sirt1 protein, mouse; sirtuin 1; transcription factor FKHRL1; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; autophagy (cellular); controlled study; gene overexpression; glucose homeostasis; glycogen storage disease type 1; glycogen storage disease type 1a; immunoprecipitation; male; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; postnatal development; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; animal; autophagy; glycogen storage disease type 1; liver; metabolism; metabolome; pathology","","Oxford University Press","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082634799"

Evaluation of periorbital features was done on the standardized frontal photographs of 400 IA, aged 18 to 26 years. The measured values were evaluated by an independent t-test. Sexual dimorphism was found in all 15 measurements. The eyebrow height, combined height of the orbit and eyebrow, eyebrow apex inclination, apex to lateral canthus distance, medial end of brow to medial canthus distance, lateral end of brow to lateral canthus distance; pretarsal skin height, palpebral fissure height, palpebral fissure inclination (PFI), and medial canthus tilt were significantly greater in female than the males. In males, eyebrow apex hairline distance, apex to lateral limbus distance, eyebrow apex angle (EAA), lower eyelid height, and interpupillary distance was significantly greater than the females. Significant ethnic difference was found between IA and MI for eyebrow height, apex to lateral limbus distance, EAA, palpebral fissure height, and PFI in male group. In female group, EAA, medial canthus tilt, and PFI were significantly greater in MI. Four types of epicanthus were observed and the brow apex between lateral limbus and lateral canthus was the most common position.

The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to analyze the clinical characteristics and therapy of two patients with VDDR-IA from two separate Chinese families, and (2) investigate the CYP27B1 gene mutations in two large pedigrees. Methods: Medical history, clinical manifestations, physical examination, radiological findings and laboratory data were analyzed from two patients with VDDR-IA. Serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25-(OH)2D3] of the two patients and their respective families were measured by ELISA and blood samples from both families was obtained for CYP27B1 gene sequence. Results: Two patients had typical manifestations and radiological evidence of rickets. Laboratory data showed hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia, along with high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. However, serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 level were low in the patients but normal in their family members. Genetic sequence identified two patients were homozygous for a duplication mutation in exon 8 of CYP27B1 gene (c.1319_1325dupCCCACCC, p.Phe443Profs*24). After treating with calcitriol and calcium, there was biochemical improvement with normalization of serum calcium and phosphorus, and radiographic evidence of compensatory skeletal mineralization. One patient developed nephrocalcinosis during follow-up. Conclusions: This study identified a recurrent seven-nucleotide insertion of CYP27B1 in two large pedigrees, and compared the clinical characteristics and individual therapy of two affected patients.

Research questions: (1) Does the actigraphy mode of operation -Proportional Integrating Measure (PIM) or Zero Crossing Mode (ZCM), responsive respectively to intensity and frequency of movements- impact sleep scoring; and (2) Can a better performing sleep scoring IA be developed by a deep learning approach combining PIM/ZCM data. Study design and Methods: ZCM and PIM plus electroencephalographic (EEG) data of 40 healthy adults (17 female, mean age: 26.7 years) were obtained from a single in-home nighttime sleep study. Effect of mode of operation was first evaluated by applying several classic deep learning models to PIM only, ZCM only, and combined ZCM/PIM data. After, a novel deep learning model was developed incorporating combined ZCM/PIM data, and its performance was compared with existing Cole-Kripke, rescored Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, and UCSD IAs. Results: Relative to the EEG reference, ZCM/PIM combined mode produced higher agreement of scoring sleep/wake epochs than only ZCM or PIM modes. The proposed novel deep learning model showed 87.7% accuracy (0.2–1% higher than the other IAs), 94.1% sensitivity (0.7–4.3% lower than the other IAs), 64.0% specificity (9.9–21.5% higher than the other IAs), and 59.9% Kappa agreement (∼6.9–11.6% higher than other IAs) in detecting sleep epochs. The proposed deep learning model did not differ significantly from the reference EEG in estimating sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE). Amount of bias and minimum detectable change in estimating SOL, WASO, TST and SE by the deep learning model was smaller than other four IAs. Interpretation: The proposed novel deep learning algorithm simultaneously incorporating ZCM/PIM mode data performs significantly better in assessing sleep than existing conventional IAs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Long-short-term memory (LSTM); Machine learning; Time series classification; Wrist actigraphy","actimetry; adult; article; artificial intelligence; clinical article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; female; human; human experiment; minimum detectable change; sensitivity and specificity; short term memory; sleep latency; sleep quality; sleep time; time series analysis; wrist","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089819218"

Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data of patients undergoing lobectomy with systematic mediastinal LN dissection or sampling for cT1N0M0 peripheral NSCLC from January 2015 to December 2018. The regional LN metastasis pattern was analyzed based on tumor size. Results: We included a total of 354 patients for analysis. The rate of hilar or intrapulmonary LN metastasis was 13.6%. When stratified by tumor size, NSCLC less than or equal to 1 cm had no hilar or intrapulmonary LN metastasis (0%) while NSCLC greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm had a significantly high rate of hilar or intrapulmonary LN metastasis (18.4%) and the rates of hilar, interlobar, and peripheral LN metastasis were also relatively high (5.4%, 5.4%, and 12.2%, respectively). NSCLC greater than 1.5 cm but less than or equal to 2 cm also had relatively high rates of hilar (6.5%) and peripheral (18.3%) LN metastasis, while NSCLC greater than 1 cm but less than or equal to 1.5 cm had significantly low rates of hilar or intrapulmonary (2.5%) and peripheral (2.5%) LN metastasis. Radiographic feature and histology were found to be independent predictors of regional LN metastasis. Conclusions: The pattern of regional LN metastasis in clinical stage IA peripheral NSCLC was significantly influenced by tumor size, which may provide evidence on surgical choice (lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection) for these early-stage NSCLC patients based on tumor size. © 2020 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","","Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lymph Node Excision; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Selection; Pneumonectomy; Retrospective Studies; Tumor Burden; adult; Article; cancer staging; female; human; human tissue; lobectomy; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; priority journal; retrospective study; tumor volume; aged; lung resection; lung tumor; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; patient selection","","Elsevier USA","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077024571"

After quantifying types of ecosystem services, this paper uses spatial correlation analysis and root-mean square deviation (RMSD) method to explore the relationships among ecosystem services and calculate the degree of spatial trade-offs (DT). Results show that the construction land increased substantially albeit at a declining rate of growth, and the degree of trade-offs (DT) increased with nontrivial differences in space. The hotspots for trade-offs are spatially aggregated in some areas but have varying patterns between ecosystem service pairs. The increasing area (IA) of construction land does not promote increased DT until the former reaches a certain threshold. With the exception of land use changes, type of industrial development is one of the key factors that influence the trade-offs of ecosystem services in the research region.

Two parameterizations of the optical depth τ(z) associated to the cosmic absorption, namely τ(z) = 2 εz and τ(z) = (1 + z) 2ε- 1 , are adopted. We find that the results are not sensitive to the fiducial cosmological models, the spatial curvature and parameterizations of τ(z). Moreover, the results from the Pantheon data alone are consistent with a transparent universe (ε= 0).

As proven in several randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses, treatment with thrombectomy lowers rates of poor functional outcomes after ELVO, compared with standard medical management. However, combined mortality rates of the most recent, high-quality clinical trials have not been collectively assessed. Objective The goal of this study was to assess the combined mortality rates of patients with ELVO following thrombectomy using data from the most recent, high-quality clinical trials. Methods Meta-analysis was performed in clinical trials comparing thrombectomy and medical management for patients with anterior circulation ELVO. Cumulative rates of mortality (mRS 6) as well as mortality or severe disability (mRS 5-6) were calculated. Results Ten clinical trials fit the inclusion criteria, including PISTE, REVASCAT, DAWN, THRACE, SWIFT PRIME, ESCAPE, DEFUSE 3, THERAPY, EXTEND-IA, and MR CLEAN, with 2233 patients assessed for mortality alone and 2229 for mortality or severe disability. There was a significantly reduced risk of death with thrombectomy compared with standard medical care (14.9% vs 18.3%, P=0.03; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98), as well as a reduced risk of mortality or severe disability (mRS 5-6) in ELVO patients treated with thrombectomy (21.1% vs 30.5%, P<0.0001; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80). Conclusions Overall, these results suggest a lower risk of death, as well as death or severe disability, in patients with ELVO treated with thrombectomy compared with medical management alone. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

It is unknown which strategy is associated with better short- and long-term outcomes.Methods:Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling and propensity score-matched analysis was used to compare the overall survival of patients with stage IA NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2015 who underwent ""early"" SBRT (0-30 days after diagnosis) versus that of patients who underwent ""delayed"" wedge resection (90-120 days after diagnosis).Results:During the study period, 570 (55%) patients underwent early SBRT and 475 (45%) underwent delayed wedge resection. In multivariable analysis, delayed resection was associated with improved survival [adjusted hazard ratio 0.61; (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-0.76)]. Propensity-score matching was used to create 2 groups of 279 patients each who received early SBRT or delayed resection that were well-matched with regard to baseline characteristics. The 5-year survival associated with delayed resection was 53% (95% CI: 45%-61%) which was better than the 5-year survival associated with early SBRT (31% [95% CI: 24%-37%]).Conclusion:In this national analysis, for patients with stage IA NSCLC, extended delay of surgery was associated with improved survival when compared to early treatment with SBRT. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Bayesian adaptive clinical trial designs offer the possibility of increased statistical efficiency, reduced development cost and ethical hazard prevention via their incorporation of evidence from external sources (historical data, expert opinions, and real-world evidence), and flexibility in the specification of interim looks. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian adaptive commensurate design that borrows adaptively from historical information and also uses a particular payoff function to optimize the timing of the study's interim analysis. The trial payoff is a function of how many samples can be saved via early stopping and the probability of making correct early decisions for either futility or efficacy. We calibrate our Bayesian algorithm to have acceptable long-run frequentist properties (Type I error and power) via simulation at the design stage. We illustrate our approach using a pediatric trial design setting testing the effect of a new drug for a rare genetic disease.

OBJECTIVE: To hypothesize that An > 1 can distinguish rupture status because vortex mode is associated with high oscillatory shear index, which, in turn, is statistically associated with rupture. METHODS: The above hypothesis is tested on a retrospective, consecutively collected database of 204 patient-specific IAs. The first 119 cases are assigned to training and the remainder to testing dataset. An is calculated based on the pulsatility index (PI) approximated either from the literature or solving an optimization problem (denoted as PI ). Student's t-test and logistic regression (LR) are used for hypothesis testing and data fitting, respectively. RESULTS: An can significantly discriminate ruptured and unruptured status with 95% confidence level (P<.0001). An(using PI) and An (using PI ) significantly predict the ruptured IAs (for training dataset An: AUC = 0.85, An : AUC = 0.90, and for testing dataset An: sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 33%, An : sensitivity = 93.1%, specificity = 52.85%). CONCLUSION: An > 1 predicts ruptured status. Unlike traditional hemodynamic parameters such as wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index, An has a physical threshold of one (does not depend on statistical analysis) and does not require time-consuming flow simulations. Therefore, An is a simple, practical discriminator of IA rupture status.

This study aimed to assess the effect of inflow angle on the hemodynamics of IAs, as well as its potential ability to predict IA rupture risk. A novel algorithm was developed to build a series of inflow angle models on patient-specific IA models, which were reconstructed from IA 3DRA image data of eleven clinical patients. Fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations were performed to quantify hemodynamic characteristics of the established IA models with various inflow angles. Hemodynamic parameters including wall shear stress (WSS), flow velocity, flow pattern, inflow zone, impingement region, pressure, and energy loss (EL) were calculated and analyzed. It was demonstrated from the analysis that a rise in the IA inflow angle is associated with the following hemodynamic changes: more direct blood flowed into the aneurysm sac, higher velocity at the upside of the aneurysm, upregulated flow velocity and WSS in the aneurysm, more complicated flow patterns, extended inflow zone, the impingement region moving upward from the neck to the apex of the aneurysm, and higher WSS and larger flow velocity at the inflow zone of the IAs. Therefore, the proposed method may be helpful in exploring the hemodynamic variations of IAs with inflow angles. The findings could be conducive to hemodynamic studies on the association between IA inflow angle and its rupture risk. © Copyright © 2020 Mo, Meng, Yang and Li.","computational fluid dynamics; fully coupled fluid-structure interaction; hemodynamics; inflow angle; intracranial aneurysms","algorithm; Article; computational fluid dynamics; digital subtraction angiography; flow rate; hemodynamic parameters; hemodynamics; human; intracranial aneurysm; pressure; shear stress; simulation","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099042968"

This article sought to review studies on the associations among polymorphisms in inflammatory cytokine genes and IA risk and to provide recommendations for future research. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted up to August 4, 2019. The associations between polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokine genes and IA risk were estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed according to race. Qualitative systematic review was conducted for variants that were studied in only one study. All analyses were performed using STATA 12.0. Results: 13 studies investigating the associations between polymorphisms in five inflammatory cytokine genes (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL6, and IL-12B) and IA were reviewed. Combined results showed that the A allele of TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism has a protective effect against IA (dominant model: OR=0.65, 95% CI=0.47–0.89, p=0.007).

The model is used to simulate a temperature flow field of a dry air cooler-finned tube based on Fluent flow field analysis software. This paper studies the cooling effect of the dry air cooler-finned tube on high-temperature and high-pressure natural gas at compressor outlet. By comparing and analyzing the relationships among natural gas mass flow, inlet air temperature, inlet natural gas temperature, and outlet natural gas temperature for an air cooler, the formula of temperature drop of dry air cooler to natural gas is fitted, and the fitting formula is verified by field operation data. The results show that the average error between the fitting results and the actual data is less than 1.5%, which proves the correctness of the fitting formula and greatly simplifies the heat transfer calculation process for air coolers. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data of patients undergoing lobectomy or segmentectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy for clinical T1N0M0 peripheral NSCLC from January 2015 to December 2018. The LN metastasis pattern was analyzed by tumor lobe location. Results: A total of 590 patients were included for analysis. The mean number of total dissected LNs was 12.3 ± 5.8 and 8.2 ± 4.1 for total dissected mediastinal LNs. The rate of mediastinal LN metastasis was 9.5%. For cases of upper lobe tumor and lower lobe tumor, 8.8% and 6.0% of them respectively metastasized to the upper LN zone (P = 0.274). However, upper lobe tumors hardly metastasized to the subcarinal (0.3%) and lower (0.3%) LN zones while for lower lobe tumors, the rate of LN metastasis was 10.2% and 5.4% respectively (both P < 0.001). However, all cases (100%) metastasizing from lower lobes to the upper LN zone had a tumor size of 2–3 cm, whereas cases with a tumor size ≤ 2 cm had no metastasis (0%). None of the tumors in the right middle lobe metastasized to the lower LN zone (0%). Conclusions: A lobe-specific LN metastasis pattern was observed in clinical stage IA peripheral NSCLC. For tumors in upper lobes (≤ 3 cm), there may be no need to dissect lower mediastinal LNs and for tumors in lower lobes (≤ 2 cm), dissecting upper mediastinal LNs may not be required. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; China; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Mediastinal Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pneumonectomy; Retrospective Studies; adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer staging; early cancer; female; human; lung lobectomy; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; mediastinum lymph node; medical record review; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; peripheral non small cell lung cancer; retrospective study; segmentectomy; tumor volume; adverse event; cancer staging; China; follow up; incidence; lung resection; lung tumor; lymph node; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; mediastinum tumor; non small cell lung cancer; pathology","","Springer","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074505026"

A growing number of lncRNAs have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but their functional and mechanistic roles remain unclear. Methods: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to investigate the molecular mechanism of UPK1A antisense RNA 1 (UPK1A-AS1). Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, EdU assays, flow cytometry, western blotting, and xenograft assays were used to confirm the role of UPK1A-AS1 in the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analyses and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to explore the interplay between UPK1A-AS1 and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2). RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down assays, western blotting, and qRT-PCR were conducted to confirm the interaction between UPK1A-AS1 and EZH2. The interaction between UPK1A-AS1 and miR-138-5p was examined by luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Finally, the expression level and prognosis value of UPK1A-AS1 in HCC were analyzed using RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Results: We showed that UPK1A-AS1, a newly identified lncRNA, promoted cellular proliferation and tumor growth by accelerating cell cycle progression. Cell cycle-related genes, including CCND1, CDK2, CDK4, CCNB1, and CCNB2, were significantly upregulated in HCC cells overexpressing UPK1A-AS1. Furthermore, overexpression of UPK1A-AS1 could protect HCC cells from cis-platinum toxicity. Mechanistically, UPK1A-AS1 interacted with EZH2 to mediate its nuclear translocation and reinforce its binding to SUZ12, leading to increased H27K3 trimethylation. Targeting EZH2 with specific small interfering RNA impaired the UPK1A-AS1-mediated upregulation of proliferation and cell cycle progression-related genes. Moreover, miR-138-5p was identified as a direct target of UPK1A-AS1. Additionally, UPK1A-AS1 was significantly upregulated in HCC, and the upregulation of UPK1A-AS1 predicted poor prognosis for patients with HCC. Conclusions: Our study revealed that UPK1A-AS1 promotes HCC development by accelerating cell cycle progression through interaction with EZH2 and sponging of miR-138-5p, suggesting that UPK1A-AS1 possesses substantial potential as a novel biomarker for HCC prognosis and therapy. © 2020, The Author(s).","EZH2; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Long non-coding RNA; miR-138-5p; Proliferation; UPK1A antisense RNA 1","Animals; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Prognosis; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Long Noncoding; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Uroplakin Ia; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; cisplatin; cyclin B1; cyclin B2; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase 2; cyclin dependent kinase 4; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; miR 138 5p; small interfering RNA; transcription factor EZH2; unclassified drug; UPK1A AS1; complementary RNA; EZH2 protein, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN138 microRNA, human; transcription factor EZH2; tumor marker; UPK1A protein, human; uroplakin 1a; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; CCNB1 gene; CCNB2 gene; CCND1 gene; CDK2 gene; CDK4 gene; cell cycle progression; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytotoxicity; gene overexpression; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; histone methylation; human; human cell; human tissue; liver cell carcinoma; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; protein RNA binding; tumor growth; upregulation; animal; apoptosis; cell motion; cell proliferation; drug screening; gene expression regulation; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; prognosis; tumor cell culture","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094217794"

Materials and methods Data were obtained from the US National Cancer Database, a nationwide facility-based cancer registry capturing up to 70% of incident cancer cases in the USA. We included cases diagnosed with early stage (clinical stages IA-IIB) NSCLC between 2010 and 2014. In an ecological analysis, we assessed changes in treatment by year of diagnosis. Among surgically treated cases, we assessed the uptake of MIS and whether conversion to open surgery took place. For cases that received thoracic radiotherapy, we assessed the uptake of SBRT. Results Among 117 370 selected cases, radiotherapy use increased 3.4 percentage points between 2010 and 2014 (p<0.0001). Surgical treatments decreased 3.5 percentage points (p<0.0001). Rates of non-treatment remained stable (range: 10.0%-10.6% (p=0.4066)). Among surgically treated stage IA cases, uptake of MIS increased from 28.7% (95% CI 27.8% to 29.7%) in 2010 to 48.6% (95% CI 47.6% to 49.6%) in 2014 (p<0.0001), while conversions decreased from 17.0% (95% CI 15.6% to 18.6%) in 2010 to 9.1% (95% CI 8.3% to 10.0%) in 2014 (p<0.0001). MIS uptake among stages IB-IIB was lower and conversion rates were higher, but time trends were similar. Uptake of SBRT among stage IA receiving thoracic radiotherapy increased from 53.4% (95% CI 51.2% to 55.6%) in 2010 to 73.0% (95% CI 71.4% to 74.6%) in 2014 (p<0.0001). SBRT uptake among stage IB increased from 32.5% (95% CI 29.9% to 35.2%) in 2010 to 48.2% (95% CI 45.6% to 50.8%) in 2014 (p<0.0001). Conclusion Between 2010 and 2014, uptake of MIS and SBRT among early stage NSCLC significantly increased, while the rate of conversions to open surgery significantly decreased. Continuing these trends may contribute to improving patient care, in particular with the expected increase in early stages due to the implementation of lung cancer screening. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare two total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anesthesia (IA) to determine if either conferred superior outcomes of these and other parameters based on randomized control trials (RCTs) only. Methods: The recommended Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and searches of electronic databases from inception to September 2018 identified 157 articles for screening. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions. Results: In total, we identified 15 RCTs that satisfied our selection criteria. There were 828 ESS cases described, with 391 (47%) and 437 (53%) being managed by TIVA and IA, respectively. Pooled analysis demonstrated significantly superior visibility scores for TIVA compared to IA based on 10-point grading scores (P = 0.049, visual analog scale; P = 0.009, Wormald scale) and 5-point grading scores (P = 0.002, Boezaart scale). Blood loss was significantly less following TIVA (P = 0.003), with no significant difference in intraoperative heart rate (P = 0.70) or mean arterial pressure (P = 0.96). Additionally, duration of surgery (P = 0.16) and anesthesia (P = 0.39) were comparable between the two approaches. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that TIVA has the potential to confer superior surgical field visibility and reduce intraoperative blood loss compared to IA in ESS. Currently, there are significant heterogeneity concerns in this meta-analysis, which temper any expectations that either approach is absolutely superior to the other. Caution should be exercised when interpreting these results until further validation can be achieved. Level of Evidence: 1A.

Two common operating routes for PELD have been introduced in the literature: transforaminal approach (TA) and interlaminar approach (IA). The purpose of our current retrospective clinical trial was to study whether the effect of IA-PELD is better than TA-PELD in the incidence of complications and clinical prognosis scores in the patients with L5-S1 lumbar disc herniation.Methods:Our present research was approved by the institutional review board in the Second Hospital of Nanjing. All the patients offered the informed consent. All the procedures containing human participants were conducted on the basis of the Helsinki Declaration. A retrospective analysis was implemented on 126 patients with L5-S1 disc herniated radiculopathy from March 2016 to March 2018, who were treated with the PELD utilizing the IA technique or the TA technique. Relevant data, such as the patients demographics, surgical duration, length of hospital stay, hospitalization expenses, complications were recorded. In our work, the outcomes of patients were determined at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after treatment. The measure of primary outcome was Oswestry Disability Index score. The other outcomes measured were Numeric Rating Scale pain scale, surgical duration, length of hospital stay, and complications. The software of SPSS Version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) was applied for the analysis of all the statistical data. When P value <.05, it was considered to be significant in statistics.Results:This protocol will provide a solid theoretical basis for exploring which PELD approach is better in treatment of lumbar disc herniation.Trial registration:This study protocol was registered in Research Registry (researchregistry5988). © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The purpose of this study was to reveal the pathogenesis and identify novel biomarkers in IA.We processed the raw microRNA (miRNA) expression profile data of IA obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. Then weighted correlation network analysis was performed to identify the hub miRNAs in IA. Target genes of hub miRNAs were predicted using multiR package. In addition, a protein-protein network as well as miRNA-mRNA network was constructed and functional and pathway enrichment analyses were done. Finally, the prediction value of hub miRNAs in IA was tested in validation set.Two modules that had relation with IA were identified and 10 hub miRNAs in each module with higher gene-module association were selected. The protein-protein network and miRNA-mRNA network contained 243 nodes and 1496 edges. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses showed that they were mainly enriched in cell cycle, cell proliferation, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Besides, hsa-miR-191-3p, hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-425-3p were proven to be valuable in prediction IA occurrence.In a word, this study reveals hub miRNAs, target genes and pathways potentially participating in formation and development of IA and screens out some candidate biomarkers.

With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in 21st-century machines, collaboration between humans and machines has become highly complicated for real-time applications. The penetration of intelligent and synthetic assistants (IA/SA) in virtually every field has opened up a path to the area of HMT. When it comes to crucial tasks such as patient treatment/care, industrial production, and defense, the use of non-standardized HMT technologies may pose a risk to human lives and cost billions of taxpayer dollars. A thorough literature survey revealed that there are not many established standards or benchmarks for HMT. In this paper, we propose a method to design an HMT based on a generalized architecture. This design includes the development of an intelligent collaborative system and the human team. Followed by the identification of processes and metrics to test and validate the proposed model, we present a novel human-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation method. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using two controlled HMT scenarios: Emergency care provider (ECP) training and patient treatment by an experienced medic. Both scenarios include humans processing visual data and performing actions that represent real-world applications while responding to a Voice-Based Synthetic Assistant (VBSA) as a collaborator that keeps track of actions. The impact of various machines, humans, and HMT parameters is presented from the perspective of performance, rules, roles, and operational limitations. The proposed HIL method was found to assist in standardization studies in the pursuit of HMT benchmarking for critical applications. Finally, we present guidelines for designing and benchmarking HMTs based on the case studies’ results analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

Prediction of crash risk is vital for avoiding secondary crashes and safeguarding highway traffic. For many years, researchers have explored several techniques for early and precise detection of crashes to aid in traffic incident management. With recent advancements in data collection techniques, abundant real-time traffic data is available for use. Big data infrastructure and machine learning algorithms can utilize this data to provide suitable solutions for the highway traffic safety system. This paper explores the feasibility of using deep learning models to detect crash occurrence and predict crash risk. Volume, Speed and Sensor Occupancy data collected from roadside radar sensors along Interstate 235 in Des Moines, IA is used for this study. This real-world traffic data is used to design feature set for the deep learning models for crash detection and crash risk prediction. The results show that a deep model has better crash detection performance and similar crash prediction performance than state of the art shallow models. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for crash risk prediction using data 1-minute, 5-minutes and 10-minutes prior to crash occurrence. It was observed that is hard to predict the crash risk of a traffic condition, 10 min prior to a crash. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crash detection; Crash prediction; Deep learning","Accidents, Traffic; Data Collection; Deep Learning; Humans; Logistic Models; Risk Assessment; Forecasting; Highway accidents; Highway administration; Highway traffic control; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Crash prediction; Data infrastructure; Detection performance; Real-time traffic datum; Suitable solutions; Traffic conditions; Traffic incidents; Traffic management centers; human; information processing; prevention and control; procedures; risk assessment; statistical model; traffic accident; Deep learning","","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076241966"

Acupuncture is an effective therapy for Internet addiction (IA). However, the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture in relieving compulsive Internet use remain unknown. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the role of the ventral striatum (VS) in the progress of IA; hence, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of acupuncture on the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and relevant network of VS in IA. Methods. Twenty-seven IA individuals and 30 demographically matched healthy control subjects (HCs) were recruited in this study. We acquired the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in IA subjects before and after 40 days of acupuncture treatment. Seed-to-voxel and ROI-to-ROI analyses were applied to detect the rsFC alterations of the VS and related network in IA subjects and to investigate the modulation effect of acupuncture on the rsFC. Results. Compared with HCs, IA subjects exhibited enhanced rsFC of the right ventral rostral putamen (VRP) with the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), premotor cortex (PMC), cerebellum, and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). In the network including these five ROIs, IA also showed increased ROI-to-ROI rsFC. Using a paired t-test in IA subjects before and after 40 days of acupuncture, the increased ROI-to-ROI rsFC was decreased (normalized to HC) with acupuncture, including the rsFC of the right VRP with the left OFC, PMC, and cerebellum, and the rsFC of the left cerebellum with the left OFC, PMC, and right vmPFC. Furthermore, the change in rsFC strength between the right VRP and left cerebellum in IA individuals was found positively correlated with the Internet craving alleviation after acupuncture. Conclusions. These findings verified the modulation effect of acupuncture on functional connectivity of reward and habit systems related to the VS in IA individuals, which might partly represent the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture on IA. © 2020 Yang Wang et al.","","Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Habits; Humans; Internet Addiction Disorder; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Reward; Young Adult; acupuncture; adolescent; adult; Article; cerebellum; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; craving; demography; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; habit; human; internet addiction; male; orbital cortex; premotor cortex; putamen; resting state network; reward; treatment response; ventral striatum; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; brain; brain mapping; internet addiction; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; young adult","","Hindawi Limited","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082744428"

Objective To investigate the feasibility of using deep neural networks (DNNs) and API to predict IA occlusion using pre- and post-intervention DSAs. Methods We analyzed DSA images of IAs pre- and post-treatment to extract API parameters in the IA dome and the corresponding main artery (un-normalized data). We implemented a two-step correction to account for injection variability (normalized data) and projection foreshortening (relative data). A DNN was trained to predict a binary IA occlusion outcome: occluded/unoccluded. Network performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and classification accuracy. To evaluate the effect of the proposed corrections, prediction accuracy analysis was performed after each normalization step. Results The study included 190 IAs. The mean and median duration between treatment and follow-up was 9.8 and 8.0 months, respectively. For the un-normalized, normalized, and relative subgroups, the DNN average prediction accuracies for IA occlusion were 62.5% (95% CI 60.5% to 64.4%), 70.8% (95% CI 68.2% to 73.4%), and 77.9% (95% CI 76.2% to 79.6%). The average AUROCs for the same subgroups were 0.48 (0.44-0.52), 0.67 (0.61-0.73), and 0.77 (0.74-0.80).

The present fMRI study employs independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate which empathy facet (Cognitive or Affective) shares resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and/or BOLD variability (rsBOLD) with IA. Healthy participants viewed an abstract nonsocial movie demonstrated to evoke strong rsFC in brain networks resembling rest (InScapes), and resultant rsFC and rsBOLD data were correlated with self-reported empathy and IA questionnaires. We demonstrate a bidirectional behavioral and neurobiological relationship between empathy and IA, depending on the type of empathy interrogated: Affective empathy and IA share both rsFC and rsBOLD, while Cognitive empathy and IA only share rsBOLD. Specifically, increased rsFC in the right inferior frontal operculum (rIFO) of a larger attention network was associated with increased vicarious experience but decreased awareness of inner body sensations. Furthermore, increased rsBOLD between brain regions of an interoceptive network was related to increased sensitivity to internal sensations along with decreased Affective empathy. Finally, increased rsBOLD between brain regions subserving a mentalizing network related to not only an improved ability to take someone’s perspective, but also a better sense of mind-body interconnectedness. Overall, these findings suggest that the awareness of one’s own internal body changes (IA) is related to the socioemotional ability of feeling and understanding another’s emotional state (empathy) and critically, that this relationship is reflected in the brain’s resting state neuroarchitecture. Methodologically, this work highlights the importance of utilizing rsBOLD as a complementary window alongside rsFC to better understand neurological phenomena. Our results may be beneficial in aiding diagnosis in clinical populations such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where participants may be unable to complete tasks or questionnaires due to the severity of their symptoms. © Copyright © 2020 Stoica and Depue.","connectivity; empathy; fMRI; ICA; interoception; resting-state; rsBOLD","adult; Article; awareness; BOLD signal; brain region; empathy; female; frontal operculum; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; interoception; intrinsic connectivity network; male; normal human; self report; young adult","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098068771"

In this study, we present a computational finite element model (FEM) of solute transport through the synovium validated by experiments on synovial explants. Unsteady diffusion of urea, a small uncharged molecule, was measured through devitalized porcine and human synovium using custom-built diffusion chambers. A multiphasic computational model was constructed and optimized with the experimental data to extract effective diffusivity for urea within the synovium. A monotonic decrease in urea concentration was observed in the donor bath over time, with an effective diffusivity found to be an order of magnitude lower in synovium versus that measured in free solution. Parametric studies incorporating an intimal cell layer with varying thickness and varying effective diffusivities were performed, revealing a dependence of drug clearance kinetics on both parameters. The findings of this study indicate that the synovial matrix impedes urea solute transport out of the joint with little retention of the solute in the matrix.  © 2021 by ASME.","","Animals; Biological Transport; Cartilage, Articular; Diffusion; Finite Element Analysis; Models, Biological; Swine; Synovial Membrane; Diffusion; Metabolism; Molecules; Solute transport; Urea; urea; Computational model; Diffusion chamber; Effective diffusivities; Experimental approaches; Monotonic decrease; Parametric study; Uncharged molecules; Varying thickness; animal tissue; Article; computer model; controlled study; diffusion coefficient; diffusivity; drug diffusion; explant; femoral condyle; finite element analysis; fluid flow; human; human tissue; in vitro study; intima; joint cavity; limit of detection; molecular weight; nonhuman; pig; steady state; synovium; thickness; animal; articular cartilage; biological model; diffusion; transport at the cellular level; Finite element method","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099817417"

This study aimed to construct a gene co-expression network by Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) to explore the potential key pathways and genes for the development of IA. Method: Six IA-related gene expression data sets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). WGCNA was used to identify modules associated with IA. Functional enrichment analysis was used to explore the potential biological functions. ROC analysis was used to find markers for predicting IA. Results: Purple, greenyellow and yellow modules were significantly associated with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, while blue and turquoise modules were significantly associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Functional modules significantly related to IA were enriched in Ribosome, Glutathione metabolism, cAMP signalling pathway, Lysosome, Glycosaminoglycan degradation and other pathways. CD163, FCEREG, FPR1, ITGAM, NLRC4, PDG, and TYROBP were up-regulated ruptured intracranial aneurysms and serum, these genes were potential circulating markers for predicting IA rupture.

The prognostic outcomes and treatment strategy of it are still unclear. A large-scale retrospective study was performed to investigate proper treatments for CSCLC. Methods: All cases of CSCLC were identified from the SEER database during the period of 2004-2016. Clinical characteristics, first-line treatments, surgical procedures and survival data including overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed. Results: A total of 37,639 SCLC patients were identified. CSCLC accounted for 2.1% (784/37,639). The mean age of CSCLC cohort is 67.3±9.9 years old. Male and white ethnicity patients were accounted for larger proportions (55.7% and 80.4%). The oncological characteristics of CSCLC were consistent with SCLC that most of patients were diagnosed as higher grade and advanced stages. The prognosis of CSCLC was better than SCLC but worse than NSCLC in IA-IIIA stages. No difference was observed in IIIB-IV. Surgery was beneficial in IA-IB stage CSCLC. Adjuvant chemotherapy seemed to have few effects on early stage patients. Trimodality treatment could significantly improve OS in IIA-IIIA CSCLC patients. Chemotherapy-based treatment is predominant choice in advanced stage patients. Conclusions: CSCLC is a rare and special subtype of SCLC. It has better survival outcome than non-CSCLC in early stage. Surgical treatment is crucial in early stage of CSCLC. Prognostic improvement might be achieved from trimodality treatment in stage IIA-IIIA. Chemotherapy-based treatments should be considered in advanced stage.

To understand the mechanisms underlying this failure, the present study investigated biomarkers associated with the lower overall survival (OS) among 2,588 patients receiving personalized peptide vaccination (PPV). Survival data were obtained from a database of 2,588 cancer patients including 399 patients with lung, 354 with prostate and 344 with colon cancer. They entered into phase II clinical trials of PPV in which 2 to 4 of 31 warehouse peptides were selected for vaccination on an individual patient basis based on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class IA-types and pre-existing peptide-specific IgG levels. Higher pre-vaccination neutrophil, monocyte and platelet counts, and lower pre-vaccination lymphocyte and red blood cell counts were inversely associated with OS, with higher sensitivities in the proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes, respectively. The most potent unfavorable and favorable factors for OS were the median percentage of neutrophils (≥64.8%) or percentage of lymphocytes (≥25.1%) with correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.98 and 0.92, respectively. Higher pre-vaccination levels of c-reactive protein and other inflammatory soluble factors were inversely associated with OS. Pre-vaccination peptide-specific immunity levels had no effect on OS, although lower immune boosting levels were inversely associated with OS. None of the 31 peptides was inversely associated with OS, although a few peptides were positively associated with it. On the whole, the findings of the present study suggested that pre-vaccination inflammatory signatures, but not those of post-vaccination immune induction, were associated with lower clinical benefits of PPV. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

A nationwide database has recently been established to address this issue. Method: A National Database was setup through a network platform, and data was collected from 70 high-volume centers (>100 esophagectomies/per year) across China. Data was entered between January 2009 and December 2014, and was analyzed in June 2015 after a minimal follow-up of 6 months for all patients. 8181 patients with complete data who received surgery for primary esophageal cancer on the Database were included in the analysis. Result: In this series, there were 6052 males and 2129 females, with a mean age of 60.5 years (range: 22-90 years). The pathology in 95.5% of patients was squamous cell carcinoma. The pathological stage distribution was 1.2% in stage 0, 2.5% in Ia, 11.5% in Ib, 14.8% in IIa, 36.1% in IIb, 19.3% in IIIa, 8.3% in IIIb, 6.2% in IIIc. 1800 patients (22.0%) with locally advanced disease received preoperative neoadjuvant therapy and 3592 patients (43.9%) underwent postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The esophagectomies were performed through left thoracotomy approach in 5870 cases (72.6%), through right chest approach in 2215 cases (27.4%) including right thoracotomy (21.3%) and VATS (6.1%). The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 0.6% (43 patients), and the overall postoperative complication rate was 11.6% (951 patients). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 82.6%, 61.6%, and 52.9%, respectively. Conclusion: This National Registry Database from high-volume centers provides a comprehensive picture of surgical management for esophageal cancer in China for the first time. Squamous cell carcinoma predominates, but there is heterogeneity with respect to the surgical approach and perioperative oncologic management. Overall, surgical mortality and morbidity rates are low, and good survival rates have been achieved due to improvement of surgical treatment technology in recent years. © The Author(s) 2019.

There are no clinically tested treatment guidelines. Reporting of cases is vital to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and potential ethnic predispositions and improve patient selection for intervention. Methods: Records of all patients diagnosed with MMD with concomitant IA who presented to our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Data related to demographic, clinical, MMD characteristics, aneurysm characteristics, surgical intervention, and follow-up were collected from the records of each patient. Aneurysm location was categorized into circle of Willis (CoW) aneurysms (originating from the CoW or its major branches) and peripheral aneurysms (arising from choroidal or lenticulostriate arteries). Results: Ten patients were found to have a total of 14 IA. All patients were white. Ten aneurysms (71%) were classified as CoW aneurysms and 4 (29%) were classified as peripheral. Seven of 10 CoW aneurysms (70%) were located in the anterior circulation, whereas 3 (30%) were located in the posterior circulation. Aneurysms of anterior and posterior circulations were most commonly treated with coil embolization, whereas peripheral artery aneurysms were most commonly treated with either cerebral revascularization alone or aneurysm excision. Conclusions: Revascularization surgery seems to be an effective method of indirectly treating IA in patients with MMD. Previous literature in addition to our series shows that endovascular embolization is safe and efficacious in treating IA of most locations in patients with MMD. The use of open microsurgery for direct aneurysm treatment in this population poses many challenges. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cerebral revascularization; Coil embolization; Intracranial aneurysm; Intracranial hemorrhage; Moyamoya disease; White","Adult; Child, Preschool; Embolization, Therapeutic; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Middle Aged; Moyamoya Disease; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; United States; adolescent; adult; Article; brain circulus arteriosus; cerebral revascularization; child; cohort analysis; coil embolization; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; conservative treatment; digital subtraction angiography; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; false aneurysm; female; follow up; human; intracranial aneurysm; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical record; medical record review; moyamoya disease; outcome assessment; population; postoperative period; practice guideline; preoperative period; retrospective study; saccular aneurysm; United States; artificial embolization; case report; Caucasian; complication; intracranial aneurysm; middle aged; moyamoya disease; pathology; preschool child; treatment outcome","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083690885"

The purpose of this study was to explore the value of FDG PET combined with high-resolution CT (HRCT) in predicting the pathologic subtypes and growth patterns of early lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the PET/CT data on ground-glass nodules (GGNs) resected from patients with stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of PET maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) combined with HRCT signs in prediction of histopathologic subtype and growth pattern of lung adenocarcinoma was evaluated. RESULTS. SUVmax was significantly higher in GGNs with invasive HRCT signs. The diameter of GGN (odds ratio, 1.660; p = 0.000) and the difference in attenuation value (odds ratio, 1.012; p = 0.011) between ground-glass components and adjacent lung tissues were independent predictors of FDG uptake by GGNs. SUVmax was higher in invasive adenocarcinoma than in adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)-minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) (median SUVmax, 2.0 vs 1.1; p = 0.008). An SUVmax of 2.0 was the optimal cutoff value for differentiating invasive adenocarcinoma from AIS-MIA. Acinar-papillary adenocarcinoma had a higher SUVmax than lepidic adenocarcinoma (median SUVmax, 2.1 vs 1.3; p = 0.037). An SUVmax of 1.4 was the optimal cutoff value for differentiating the growth pattern of adenocarcinoma. Use of PET/CT with HRCT significantly improved efficacy for differentiating invasive adenocarcinoma from AIS-MIA. However, use of HRCT cannot significantly improve the diagnostic efficacy of FDG PET in the evaluation of tumors with different growth patterns. CONCLUSION. FDG PET can be used to predict the histopathologic subtypes and growth patterns of early lung adenocarcinoma. Combined with HRCT, it has value for predicting invasive histopathologic subtypes but no significance for predicting invasive growth patterns. © American Roentgen Ray Society","Ground-glass opacity nodules; High-resolution CT; Histopathologic subtype; Lung adenocarcinoma; PET","Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Adult; Aged; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Retrospective Studies; fluorodeoxyglucose; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; acinar cell carcinoma; acinar papillary adenocarcinoma; adenocarcinoma in situ; adult; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer staging; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; ground glass nodule; health care management; high resolution computer tomography; histopathology; human; human tissue; lepidic adenocarcinoma; lung adenocarcinoma; lung nodule; lung parenchyma; major clinical study; male; maximum standardized uptake value; minimally invasive adenocarcinoma; pathology; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; diagnostic imaging; lung adenocarcinoma; middle aged; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; procedures; tumor invasion","","American Roentgen Ray Society","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078526887"

The goal of this study was to characterize the use of brain imaging among Medicare patients diagnosed with stage IA NSCLC. Methods: Using data from linked SEER-Medicare claims, we identified patients diagnosed with AJCC 8th edition stage IA NSCLC in 2004 through 2013. Patients were classified as having received brain imaging if they underwent head CT or brain MRI from 1 month before to 3 months after diagnosis. We identified factors associated with receipt of brain imaging using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among 13,809 patients with stage IA NSCLC, 3,417 (25%) underwent brain imaging at time of diagnosis. The rate of brain imaging increased over time, from 23.5% in 2004 to 28.7% in 2013 (P5.0006). There was significant variation in the use of brain imaging across hospital service areas, with rates ranging from 0% to 64.0%. Factors associated with a greater likelihood of brain imaging included older age (odds ratios [ORs] of 1.16 for 70–74 years, 1.13 for 75–79 years, 1.31 for 80–84 years, and 1.46 for $85 years compared with 65–69 years; all P,.05), female sex (OR, 1.09; P,.05), black race (OR 1.23; P,.05), larger tumor size (ORs of 1.23 for 11–20 mm and 1.28 for 21–30 mm tumors vs 1–10 mm tumors; all P,.05), and higher modified Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score (OR, 1.28 for score .1 vs score of 0; P,.05). Conclusions: Roughly 1 in 4 patients with stage IA NSCLC received brain imaging at the time of diagnosis despite national recommendations against the practice. Although several patient factors are associated with receipt of brain imaging, there is significant geographic variation across the United States. Closer adherence to clinical guidelines is likely to result in more cost-effective care. © 2020 Harborside Press.

No significant difference was observed in C index between AS and PS models for disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in either cohort. χ2 statistic and Hazard Ratio for PFS, DSS and OS showed better discrimination between IA and IB, IIB and IIIA, IIIA and IIIB in AS model than PS model. Besides, patients with IIIC unchanged stage showed worse PFS compared to those with AS IIIA or IIIB upstaged to PS IIIC in both cohorts(p = 0.049, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that prognostic staging system did not provide better discriminatory ability in predicting TNBCs prognosis than anatomic staging system. © 2020 The Author(s).","AJCC 8th; Anatomic stage; Prognostic stage; Triple negative breast cancer","Cohort Studies; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer risk; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cohort analysis; controlled study; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; factual database; follow up; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; overall survival; pathological anatomy; prediction; progesterone receptor positive breast cancer; progression free survival; retrospective study; risk assessment; survival analysis; survival rate; survival time; triple negative breast cancer; tumor volume; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; pathology; prognosis; proportional hazards model; triple negative breast cancer","","BioMed Central Ltd.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077560008"

Methods: From December 2013 to December 2019, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients who were diagnosed with acute anterior shoulder dislocation associated with glenoid and GT fractures in our hospital. According to the fracture site, a glenoid fracture group and a greater tuberosity fracture (GT) group were established, and the morphological characteristics of both glenoid and GT fractures were measured and statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 41 patients (43 shoulders) met the inclusion criteria (39 unilateral shoulders and 2 bilateral shoulders). The mean age was 50.21 years (range, 22–71 years). A total of 27 shoulder injuries (62.8%) were split GT fractures and 33 shoulder injuries (76.7%) were combined with rotator cuff tears. The mean size of glenoid fragments was 30.16% and the mean displacement was 8.85 mm. The mean size of GT fragments was 28.43 mm. The mean superoinferior and anteroposterior displacements of the GT fragment were 6.77 mm and 4.96 mm, respectively. There was a negative correlation between the size of glenoid and GT fracture fragments (r = −0.64, P < 0.05). The glenoid fragments in the Ideberg type Ia glenoid fracture group were smaller than those in the Ideberg type II glenoid fracture group (28.41% and 40.95%, respectively), while the size of GT fragments in the type Ia group were larger than those in the type II group (29.77 mm and 20.21 mm, respectively) (P < 0.05). The GT fragments in the split GT fracture group were larger than those in the avulsion or depression GT fracture group (33.69 mm, 19.07 mm and 21.12 mm, respectively), while the size of glenoid fragments in the split GT fracture group were smaller than those in the avulsion or depression GT fracture group (23.57%, 41.37%, and 43.42%, respectively) (P < 0.05). As for the displacement direction of GT fragments, depression fractures were mainly inferior displacements, avulsion fractures were mainly anterosuperior displacements, while split fractures were mainly posteroinferior displacements (P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the type and the fragment size of GT fractures have a significant influence on the size of glenoid fragments. Conclusion: Acute anterior shoulder dislocations associated with glenoid and GT fractures are often combined with rotator cuff tears. There is a negative correlation between the size of glenoid and GT fragments, and split GT fractures are most common. Such injuries are highly correlated to the relative spatial location between the GT and the glenoid when the shoulder dislocates. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: Data on clinical and demographic features, maintenance treatment, disease course, and outcomes in individuals with IA (rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis) with symptomatic COVID-19 infection were prospectively assessed via web-based questionnaire followed by individual phone calls and electronic medical record review. Baseline characteristics and medication use were summarized for hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and outcomes with the different medication classes were compared using multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 103 patients with IA were included in the study (80 with confirmed COVID-19 and 23 with high suspicion of COVID-19). Hospitalization was required in 26% of the participants, and 4% died. Patients who were hospitalized were significantly more likely to be older (P < 0.001) and have comorbid hypertension (P = 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.02). IA patients taking oral glucocorticoids had an increased likelihood of being admitted for COVID-19 (P < 0.001), while those receiving maintenance anticytokine biologic therapies did not. Conclusion: Among patients with underlying IA, COVID-19 outcomes were worse in those receiving glucocorticoids but not in patients receiving maintenance anticytokine therapy. Further work is needed to understand whether immunomodulatory therapies affect COVID-19 incidence. © 2020, American College of Rheumatology","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biological Products; COVID-19; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; adalimumab; angiotensin receptor antagonist; certolizumab pegol; cytokine; cytokine receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; glucocorticoid; golimumab; guselkumab; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 23; ixekizumab; Janus kinase inhibitor; methotrexate; secukinumab; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; ustekinumab; antirheumatic agent; biological product; glucocorticoid; adult; aged; ankylosing spondylitis; anosmia; arthritis; Article; biological therapy; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; disease association; disease course; disease severity; dry cough; dyspnea; electronic medical record; female; fever; follow up; geriatric patient; high risk patient; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; hypertension; immunotherapy; incidence; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multivariate logistic regression analysis; New York; odds ratio; phase 1 clinical trial; priority journal; prospective study; psoriatic arthritis; questionnaire; rheumatoid arthritis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; spondylarthritis; complication; rheumatoid arthritis; treatment outcome; very elderly","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092746735"

A total of 622 C. jejuni isolates recovered from food animals and retail meats in the United States through the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System between 2013 and 2017 were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq. Sequences were combined with WGS data of 222 human isolates downloaded from NCBI and analyzed by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and traditional MLST. cgMLST allelic difference (AD) thresholds of 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 identified 828, 734, 652, 543, 422, 298 and 197 cgMLST types among the 844 isolates, respectively, and traditional MLST identified 174 ST. The cgMLST scheme allowing an AD of 200 (cgMLST200) revealed strong correlation with MLST. cgMLST200 showed 40.5% retail chicken isolates, 56.5% swine, 77.4% dairy cattle and 78.9% beef cattle isolates shared cgMLST sequence type with human isolates. All ST-8 had the same cgMLST200 type (cgMLST200-12) and 74.3% of ST-8 and 75% cgMLST200-12 were confirmed as sheep abortion virulence clones by PorA analysis. Twenty-nine acquired resistance genes, including 21 alleles of blaOXA, tetO, aph(3′ )-IIIa, ant(6)-Ia, aadE, aad9, aph(2′ )-Ig, aph(2′ )-Ih, sat4 plus mutations in gyrA, 23SrRNA and L22 were identified. Resistance genotypes were strongly linked with cgMLST200 type for certain groups including 12/12 cgMLST200-510 with the A103V substitution in L22 and 10/11 cgMLST200-608 with the T86I GyrA substitution associated with macrolide and quinolone resistance, respectively. In summary, the cgMLST200 threshold scheme combined with resistance genotype information could provide an excellent subtyping scheme for source attribution of human C. jejuni infections. © 2020 by the authors.","Campylobacter jejuni; CgMLST; Foodborne pathogens; PorA; Source attribution","DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A; genomic DNA; macrolide; porin A; quinolone; ribosome protein; RNA 23S; aad9 gene; aade gene; abortion; ant(6) 1a; antibiotic resistance; aph(2') 1g gene; aph(2') 1h gene; aph(3') 3a gene; Article; bacterium isolate; beef cattle; blaoxa gene; Campylobacter enteritis; Campylobacter jejuni; chicken; controlled study; dairy cattle; foodborne pathogen; gene; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genotype; hierarchical clustering; human; illumina sequencing; meat; microbial genetics; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; pig; prevalence; sat4 gene; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; sheep; teto gene; whole genome sequencing","","MDPI AG","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087401648"

After considering the absorption of incident light by the liquid medium, this paper conducts simulation analysis of apparent optical parameters. At the same time, this paper simulates the extinction spectrum of common RR distributed visible light using the apparent extinction coefficient and proposes a method for extracting specific wavelengths based on the immune particle swarm optimization algorithm (IA-PSO). According to this method, the wavelength point with the smallest root mean square error between the simulated extinction value and the extinction value is selected as the measuring wavelength, which can effectively eliminate the subjective effect in the process of optimal wavelength selection. To verify the validity of the method proposed by this paper, inversion calculation of the unimodal R-R distributed spectra and the bimodal R-R distributed spectra is performed respectively in the independent mode using the PT algorithm with simulated data. In the non-independent mode, the inversion of particle size distribution is performed based on the genetic optimization algorithm. The simulation experiment results indicate that the proposed method for extracting the specific wavelengths of milk fat particles in the liquid absorbing medium can effectively improve the accuracy and stability of the inversion results and reduce measuring errors. © 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.

Methods: Data from T1-2N1micM0 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy from 2010–2014 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The chi-square test, binomial logistics regression, receiver-operating characteristics curve, competing-risk regression model, Cox proportional hazards regression model, and proportional hazard assumption were used for statistical analyses. Results: We identified 4,729 patients, including 1,062 patients were received postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT). Stage change occurred in 88.2% of the patients, of which 84.4% were downstaged and 3.7% were upstaged. Patients with higher pathological prognostic stages were independently predicted to receive PMRT. The 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was 97.5, 93.7, 90.1, 86.0, and 73.5% in disease stages IA, IB, IIA, IIB, and IIIA, respectively, according to the 8th edition criteria (P < 0.001). The AJCC 8th edition demonstrated moderate discriminative ability, and it had a significantly better ability to predict the BCSS than the AJCC 7th edition criteria (P < 0.001). The multivariate prognostic analysis showed that the new pathological prognostic staging was an independent prognostic factor affecting the BCSS. The BCSS worsened with an increase in the stage. The PMRT did not affect the BCSS regardless of the pathological prognostic stage. Similar trends were found using the competing-risks regression model. Conclusions: The 8th AJCC breast cancer pathological prognostic staging system downstaged 84.4% of patients with T1-2N1micM0 disease and the survival outcome prediction with this staging system was more accurate than the AJCC 7th edition system. Our study does not support using the prognostic stage as a guideline to escalate of PMRT. © Copyright © 2020 Shi, Lian, Chi, Zhou, Lei, Hua, Wang, He and Wu.","AJCC staging; breast cancer; mastectomy; nodal micrometastasis; radiotherapy","epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; adult; area under the curve; Article; breast cancer; breast reconstruction; cancer grading; cancer mortality; cancer pathology; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer survival; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease free survival; female; follow up; histology; histopathology; hospitalization; human; human tissue; major clinical study; mastectomy; micrometastasis; middle aged; predictive value; prognostic assessment; receiver operating characteristic; recurrence free survival; risk factor; sample size; tumor volume","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098739577"

Methods: This multicenter study cohort of 623 lung adenocarcinomas was split into training (n = 331), testing (n = 143), and external validation dataset (n = 149). Random forest models were built using selected radiomics features, results from FS, lesion volume, clinical and semantic features, and combinations thereof. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) was used to evaluate model performances. The diagnosis accuracy, calibration, and decision curves of models were tested. Results: The radiomics-based model shows good predictive performance and diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing IA from PM, with AUCs of 0.89, 0.89, and 0.88, in the training, testing, and validation datasets, respectively, and with corresponding accuracies of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.85. Adding lesion volume and FS significantly increases the performance of the model with AUCs of 0.96, 0.97, and 0.96, and with accuracies of 0.91, 0.94, and 0.93 in the three datasets. There is no significant difference in AUC between the FS model enriched with radiomics and volume against an FS model enriched with volume alone, while the former has higher accuracy. The model combining all available information shows minor non-significant improvements in AUC and accuracy compared with an FS model enriched with radiomics and volume. Conclusions: Radiomics signatures are potential biomarkers for the risk of IA, especially in combination with FS, and could help guide surgical strategy for pulmonary nodules patients.

We investigated the utility of image analysis (IA) to quantify CD8+ T cells in a series of matched small biopsies and resections of NSCLC. Methods: CD8 immunohistochemistry was performed on cell-blocks (CB), core needle biopsies (CNB) and corresponding resections from primary NSCLCs. Slides were digitised using an Aperio AT2 scanner (Leica) and annotated by whole slide image (WSI) or fields of view occupied by tissue spots (TS). Quantitative IA was performed with a customised Aperio algorithm (Leica). CD8 scores (number of T cells with 1-3+ staining/total area) were then compared. Results: Forty-four cases with CB or CNB material and a corresponding resection were analysed. Average CD8 score was determined in CB (7.67 WSI, 77.67 TS) and/or CNB (47.35 WSI, 325.67 TS), and corresponding resections (190.35 WSI, 336.58 TS). CD8 score concordance was highest (78.6%) for CNBs using WSI annotation. Overall, small biopsies (CB or CNB) correlated with the resection in 71.4% cases using WSI and 63.3% cases using TS annotation. IA performed better for low CD8 scores. Conclusions: These findings show that CD8 density in NSCLC can be quantified by IA in small biopsies and cell blocks, achieving the best concordance using WSI scores. Discrepancies were attributed to values near the cut-off and background detection of staining. These data warrant future studies with more cases and follow-up data to further investigate the clinical utility of IA for CD8 analysis in NSCLC. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CD8; cytology; cytopathology; immunotherapy; personalised medicine; quantitation","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biopsy, Large-Core Needle; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cytodiagnosis; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Male; Middle Aged; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; adult; aged; Article; cancer surgery; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; cytology; cytology cell block; cytopathology; cytoplasm; erythrocyte; female; human; human cell; human tissue; image analysis; immunohistochemistry; lung adenocarcinoma; lung biopsy; lung resection; male; needle biopsy; non small cell lung cancer; primary tumor; priority journal; quantitative analysis; squamous cell lung carcinoma; tumor biopsy; tumor microenvironment; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytodiagnosis; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; image processing; immunology; large core needle biopsy; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; tumor associated leukocyte; very elderly","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083046202"

The purpose of this study was to determine if the LESS and FMSTM are correlated or if they can be used as complementary assessments of preseason injury risk for anterior cruciate ligament injury.Methods:FMSTM and LESS were used to conduct a cohort study of 126 male National Collegiate Athletic Association Division IA football players. One hundred and eleven players met the criteria for inclusion during data review. At risk and not at risk LESS scores of players and FMSTM exercise score status were compared using Welch's t-test. Associations between FMSTM composites and LESS scores were evaluated using linear regression.Results:The average LESS score was 5.51±1.34, and the average composite FMSTM score was 11.77±2.13 (max=15). A poor FMSTM squat score (≤1 or asymmetry present) was associated with a higher LESS score (P<0.001). No other FMSTM individual exercise score was associated with an at-risk LESS score (P>0.05). Composite FMSTM score was loosely associated with the LESS score (R-squared=0.0677, P=0.006). Prior history of an ACL injury and player position were not associated with LESS score on multivariate regression (P>0.05).Conclusions:The LESS and FMSTM are not well correlated and may serve as complementary assessments for preseason injury risk.Level of Evidence:Level III.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy among the staging groups of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for PDAC. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis was performed by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) (2004–2015) database and multi-institutional dataset (2010–2018). Baseline clinicopathologic characteristics of PDAC patients, including age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education level, county income level, county unemployed rate, insurance status, grade, stage, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, were collected. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. The SEER and multi-institutional data were adjusted with 1:1 ratio propensity score matching (PSM). Results: In total, 6,274 and 1,361 PDAC patients were included from the SEER database and multi-institutional dataset, respectively. Regardless of the count of resected lymph nodes, adjuvant chemotherapy prolonged the long-term OS time for stage IB, IIA, IIB, and III patients in both SEER and multi-institutional cohorts. Nevertheless, adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide additional clinical benefits even after a PSM adjustment for stage IA patients in both SEER and multi-institutional cohorts. Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy improved the long-term survival of stage IB, IIA, IIB, and III PDAC patients; however, it demonstrated no survival benefit in stage IA PDAC patients. Thus, adjuvant chemotherapy should not be recommended for stage IA PDAC patients. These would significantly reduce the economic burden of society and improve the life quality of stage IA PDAC patients. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Xu, Chen, Wei, Zhou, Chen, Shen and Wang.","chemotherapy; End Results (SEER); Epidemiology; overall survival; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; prognosis; Surveillance","adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer localization; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cohort analysis; disease free survival; disease specific survival; female; follow up; histology; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; propensity score; quality of life; retrospective study; survival analysis; very elderly","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088972202"

However, longitudinal information can often be inferred from cross-sectional datasets as demonstrated by ana-tomists’ use of geometric morphometrics to build evolutionary trees, reconstructing species inter-re-lationships based on morphologic landmarks. Objective: We adopted these tools to analyze cross-sectional image data and infer relationships between IA morphologies. Methods: On 3D reconstructions of 52 middle cerebral arteries (MCA) IAs (9 ruptured) and 10 IA-free MCAs (baseline geometries), 7 semi-automated landmarks were placed at the proximal parent artery and maximum height. From these, 64 additional landmarks were computationally generated to create a 71-landmark point cloud of 213 xyz coordinates. This data was normalized by Procrustes transformation and used in the principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and phylogenetic analyses. Results: Principal component analysis showed separation of IA-free MCA geometries and group-ing of ruptured IAs from unruptured IAs. Hierarchical clustering delineated a cluster of only unrup-tured IAs that were significantly smaller and more spherical than clusters that had ruptured IAs. Phylogenetic classification placed ruptured IAs more distally in the tree than unruptured IAs, indi-cating greater shape derivation. Groups of unruptured IAs were observed, but ruptured IAs were in-variably found in mixed lineages with unruptured IAs, suggesting that some pathways of shape change may be benign while others are more associated with rupture. Conclusion: Geometric morphometric analyses of larger datasets may indicate particular pathways of shape change leading toward aneurysm rupture versus stabilization. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cerebral aneurysm; Geometric morphometrics; Longitudinal data; Natural history; Phylogenetic analysis; Subarachnoid hemorrhage","Aged; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Cerebral Artery; adult; aged; anatomic landmark; Article; brain artery aneurysm; brain artery aneurysm rupture; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; female; geometry; hierarchical clustering; history; human; major clinical study; male; middle cerebral artery; morphometry; phylogeny; principal component analysis; priority journal; three-dimensional imaging; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; intracranial aneurysm; middle aged","","Bentham Science Publishers","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102280979"

This study evaluates recurrent hypoglycemia, fragmentation of care and mortality in a large urban center. Methods: The Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (CHDR), a de-identified electronic health record data set from institutions across Chicago, identified 9741 patients with diabetes (DM) who had hypoglycemia (emergency department (ED) or inpatient admission (IA)) from 2006 to 2012. Recurrence was defined as more than one hypoglycemia encounter, and fragmentation of health care was defined as an ED visit or IA for hypoglycemia at >1 site. Results: 187,644 patients were identified with DM; of 9741 patients with hypoglycemia, 2857 (29.3%) had recurrence. Patients with ≥4 hypoglycemic encounters (n = 1035) represented 10.6%, but accounted for 40.3% hypoglycemic encounters. Of 2857 patients with recurrence, 304 patients (10.6%) had fragmented care. In those with high hypoglycemic encounters (≥4), 22% (N = 226) had ≥10 encounters; race and insurance status differences were associated with number of hypoglycemic encounters. Having hypoglycemia was associated with increased mortality compared to no hypoglycemia (n = 2696, 27.7% vs n = 20,188, 11.4%; p < 0.00001 by chi-square).

ICI-induced IA treatment requires balancing immune activation to fight cancer and immune modulation to control autoimmunity. Our objective was to learn how patients experience ICI-induced IA and potentially conflicting treatment decisions. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants with rheumatologist-diagnosed ICI-induced IA recruited from a longitudinal cohort. The interview guide probed the experience of diagnosis and treatment, symptoms and impact of ICI-induced IA, coping mechanisms, and treatment decision-making. Two researchers used an iterative coding process to identify themes through inductive thematic analysis and consensus. An overarching conceptual framework was derived from the qualitative analysis to identify care gaps perceived by patients, and inform future research. Results: Fourteen patients with ICI-induced IA participated in semi-structured interviews. Five overarching themes were identified: An awareness gap leading to delay in diagnosis of IA, descriptors of ICI-induced IA and relationship to other adverse events, emotional and quality-of-life impact of IA, fear and decision-making, and contextual factors including social support. Conclusions: As reported by patients, ICI-induced IA had a significant functional and emotional impact, even as compared to cancer and other ICI-induced side effects. Increasing awareness and integrated care of ICI-induced IA, and increasing social support are key targets for improving patient care. Additionally, more data on cancer outcomes in patients requiring immunomodulation for ICI-induced IA would help address fear and uncertainty for patients, and better support them through therapeutic decisions. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cancer; Immunotherapy; Inflammatory arthritis; Quality of life; Social support","immune checkpoint inhibitor; immunomodulating agent; unclassified drug; adult; adverse outcome; Article; cancer therapy; clinical article; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; consensus; coping behavior; emotion; fear; female; human; longitudinal study; male; medical decision making; middle aged; priority journal; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; quality of life; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatologist; scientist; semi structured interview; social support","","BioMed Central","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089753868"

The cause of the disease remains unknown. Patients and Methods: This study reported and summarized 13 sporadic cases of Type I MSL patients in terms of histopathology and cellular and molecular biology and assessed the CBLB c.197A>T mutation in the IRS1-PI3K-Akt pathway. Results: The clinical data showed that these 13 Type I patients were all male with a mean age of 57.0 ± 6.6 years old and consumed alcohol heavily. The laboratory tests revealed that most of the patients had hyperuricemia, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, or insulin resistance; however, their blood lipid levels were close to a normal range. The imaging data exhibited lipomas that only occurred subcutaneously but not viscerally, ie, Types Ia (15.4%), Ib (30.8%), and Ic (53.8%). The molecular analyses of adipocytes of isoprenaline stimulated human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hADSCs) isolated from the adipose tissue lipoma-like masses (ATLLM) demonstrated that these adipocytes did not express UCP-1. The Cbl proto-oncogene B (CBLB), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, was associated with insulin resistance and obesity and was mutated (ie, CBLB c.197A>T) in four MSL patients after the whole genome and Sanger sequencing of the blood samples. Furthermore, the CBLB c.197A>T mutation induced hADSC resistance to insulin by inactivation of the IRS-1-PI3K-AKT pathway. Conclusion: This study analyzed clinical, histopathological, and cellular and molecular biological characterizations of 13 Type I MSL patients and identified the CBLB c.197A>T heterozygous mutation that could be responsible for MSL metabolic dysfunction or even MSL development. © 2020 Chen et al.","CBLB; Characterization; Manifestation; MSL; Multiple symmetric lipomatosis","Cbl protein; Cbl proto oncogene B; insulin receptor substrate 1; isoprenaline; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cell; adipose tissue lipoma like masses; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; cytology; diabetes mellitus; disease association; enzyme inactivation; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; hyperinsulinemia; hyperuricemia; insulin resistance; IRS1 PI3K Akt signaling pathway; laboratory test; lipomatosis; male; mesenchymal stroma cell; molecular biology; mutational analysis; obesity; Pi3K/Akt signaling; Sanger sequencing; type 1a multiple symmetric lipomatosis; type 1b multiple symmetric lipomatosis; type 1c multiple symmetric lipomatosis; whole genome sequencing","","Dove Medical Press Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092129764"

The positive rate of thyroglobulin antibody (19·1 %) and the prevalence of AITD (21·8 %) were higher in the ID areas; the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was lowest in the ID areas (7·3 %) and highest in the IE area (16·3 %). Among the AITD population, urinary iodine concentration, free triiodothyronine, FT4 and TSH had a non-linear correlation with serum iodine; abnormal TSH level, serum iodine concentration > 110 g/l and goitre were risk factors for AITD in adults, especially females. Our data collectively suggest that universal salt iodisation has improved the iodine nutritional status of the population in ID areas in China. Non-step-by-step iodine fortification may induce the transformation of thyroid autoimmune diseases from recessive-to-dominant in susceptible people. Moreover, enhanced monitoring of thyroid function in people with AITD is important. © The Author(s), 2020.

In this paper, we propose a novel IM technique, called signal dodging and interference guiding (SDIG). With this method, we first intellectually move the data transmission away from the interference, which we call signal dodging, hence can partially avoid the influence of disturbance to the desired signal. Then, we employ existing IM method, including zero-forcing (ZF) reception, interference alignment (IA), interference steering (IS), etc., to further eliminate the impact of interference on the interfered receiver (Rx) via nullifying the disturbance (using ZF) or guiding/adjusting the interference to be orthogonal to the desired transmission (with IA, IS, etc.). The SDIG consists of two-phase processing, the first one is modifying the desired signal, and the second one is mitigating the interference. This is similar to the idea of Taichi in that both involve the actions of passive defense and active attack. Therefore, we also use the term Taichi as an equivalent for SDIG. Our in-depth analysis and simulation have shown that with the proposed scheme, the spatial domain communication resource of the interfered transmission-pair can be properly and efficiently utilized, thus both the interfered user's and the system's spectral efficiency (SE) can be significantly improved. © 2020 Institute of Information Science.

However, the costs associated with switching SC-TNFis are largely unknown. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to explore costs of healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) associated with switching SC-TNFi treatment among biologic-naïve Swedish patients with IA. Methods: Using population-based register data, adult patients filling prescriptions between May 6, 2010 and December 31, 2014 for an SC-TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, and golimumab) were included. Patients switching treatment (cyclers) were matched to treatment persistent patients on the basis of propensity score and follow-up time. HCRU-associated costs were captured and compared 12 months before and 12 months after the index date (defined as the date of the switch). Results: A balanced cohort of 594 matched pairs was derived. Prior to the index date, cyclers had significantly higher non-treatment HCRU costs compared to persistent patients ($3815 [3498–4147] vs. $2900; 95%CI [2565–3256]). However, 12 months after the index date, cyclers had significantly increased their non-treatment HCRU costs while persistent patients lowered theirs ($822 [232–1490] vs. $− 313 [− 664–36]). This resulted in a statistically significant difference in difference of $1135 between the groups. Conclusions: In biologic-naïve patients treated with SC-TNFi for IA, cyclers significantly increased their non-treatment HCRU costs 12 months after switching treatment while persistent patients lowered their costs during the same time period. As these findings indicate that differences in treatment persistence may have an impact on costs, further research utilizing more comprehensive data sources in alternate settings is warranted. © 2020, The Author(s).","Ankylosing spondylitis; Biologics; Cost; Inflammatory arthritis; Psoriatic arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Rheumatology; Subcutaneous TNFα inhibitors; Switching; Treatment persistence","Adalimumab; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Certolizumab Pegol; Cohort Studies; Drug Substitution; Etanercept; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sweden; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; adalimumab; certolizumab pegol; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; golimumab; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; steroid; adalimumab; antirheumatic agent; certolizumab pegol; etanercept; golimumab; monoclonal antibody; tumor necrosis factor; adult; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; health care cost; health care utilization; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; outpatient care; prescription; psoriatic arthritis; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; sensitivity analysis; Swedish citizen; treatment duration; treatment outcome; aged; comparative study; drug substitution; economics; health care cost; rheumatoid arthritis; Sweden; very elderly","","Adis","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087676376"

As a result, interference becomes a key impediment to the improvement of network performance, thus requiring a thorough investigation. There have been numerous interference management (IM) methods, of which interference alignment (IA) has been receiving significant attention in recent years. IA compresses the dimension of interference subspace by confining multiple interfering signals into a finite subspace, so that the desired signal subspace may be maximized. However, when IA is applied to the situation where multiple interferences are from the same source, the interference subspace cannot be compressed due to the fact that if these interfering components are aligned in the same direction at their unintended receiver (Rx), they will become indistinguishable at their desired Rx. To solve this problem, we propose Inside-Out Precoding (IOP). With IOP, multiple data streams that may cause interference to the other Rx are at first pre-processed at the interfering transmitter (Tx), by employing an inner-precoder which makes the streams spatially separable, and then, by exploiting interactions among wireless signals, multiple interfering components are treated as an effective interference to which an outer-precoder is applied, so that multiple interferences can be compressed into one dimension at the interfered Rx while making them distinguishable at their desired Rx. We present two IOP realizations-forward IOP (F-IOP) and backward IOP (B-IOP)-and propose a protocol to realize the synchronization of processing parameters at the interfering Tx and its intended Rx so that the Rx can adapt itself to the precoding strategy employed at the Tx side. Our in-depth analysis and simulation results have shown that the proposed IOP can effectively manage multiple interferences from the same source while guaranteeing the performance of transmission from the interfering Tx to its intended Rx. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","interference alignment; interference management; Mobile communication; precoding; signal processing","Data streams; Interference alignment; Interference management; Interference subspace; Interfering signals; Multiple data streams; Multiple interferences; Processing parameters; Vehicular Communication Networks; 5G mobile communication systems","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090381975"

Therefore, we sought to determine whether patients with stage I EOOC had improved overall survival (OS) following receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: Patients with pathological stage I ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Demographics, pathologic factors including tumor grade, and treatment information including receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy were collected. The impact of chemotherapy on OS was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier curves, and compared with log-rank tests. Multivariate Cox analysis was performed to control for confounders. Results: A total of 4538 patients were identified and the median age was 55 years The rate of adjuvant chemotherapy use was 50.9%. Higher rates were noted among patients with stage IC and grade 3 tumors. Following stratification by tumor grade, substage and extent of lymphadenectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a survival benefit for patients with grade 2 tumors who did not undergo (stage IA/IB: 95.7% vs 83%, p = 0.038; stage IC: 84.5% vs 84.8%, p = 0.39) or had limited lymphadenectomy (stage IA/IB: 96% vs 89.5%, p = 0.03; stage IC: 97.2% vs 83.9%, p = 0.001). A survival difference was also seen for patients with grade 3 tumors who did not undergo lymphadenectomy but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an overall survival benefit for patients with inadequately-staged, grade 2 stage I ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma. A possible benefit for inadequately-staged patients with grade 3 tumors cannot be excluded. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carcinoma; Chemotherapy; Endometrioid; Ovary","Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Ovarian Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; United States; antineoplastic agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; Article; cancer staging; clinical feature; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; insurance; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; middle aged; ovary adenocarcinoma; overall survival; priority journal; survival rate; adjuvant chemotherapy; cancer grading; endometrioid carcinoma; epidemiology; factual database; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; ovary tumor; pathology; retrospective study; survival analysis; United States","","Academic Press Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076475765"

This study aimed to: (1) determine the frequency of retrospective ITC detection in patients with endometrial carcinoma and reported negative SLNs determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination only; and (2) determine the clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients with endometrial carcinoma and previously undetected ITCs. Methods 474 SLNs from 155 patients with endometrial carcinoma and reported negative SLNs were subjected to an immunohistochemistry protocol which included staining slides with cytokeratin at 1, 10, 20, and 50 μm levels, to examine for ITCs. Clinicopathological data of patients with ITCs detected by this method were analyzed to determine patient outcomes. Results Using immunohistochemistry, ITCs were detected in 5.7% (27/474) of SLNs and 13.5% (21/155) of patients with previously reported negative SLNs. In this patient cohort, 95.2% (20/21) had endometrioid histology, with the remaining case being carcinosarcoma. 38.1% (8/21) received adjuvant therapy (either brachytherapy alone (4/8) or chemotherapy and radiation (4/8)) based on other parameters, while 61.9% (13/21) had no adjuvant therapy. Of the patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy, all had endometrioid histology and 84.6% (11/13) were International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA. No patients (0/13) recurred after a median follow-up of 31.5 (range 2-84.4) months. Discussion In this study, 38.1% of patients with previously undetected ITCs had adjuvant treatment based on other high risk factors; as such, reporting ITCs would not have altered patient management for those who received adjuvant chemotherapy. To date, no patients with previously undetected ITCs without adjuvant treatment had a recurrence, suggesting that ITC detection may not be clinically relevant. © 2020 IGCS and ESGO.","endometrial neoplasms; sentinel lymph node; surgical oncology","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sentinel Lymph Node; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy; antineoplastic agent; cytokeratin; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; Article; brachytherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; carcinosarcoma; clear cell carcinoma; clinical article; cohort analysis; endometrioid carcinoma; endometrium carcinoma; external beam radiotherapy; female; follow up; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lymph vessel metastasis; micrometastasis; middle aged; patient care; pelvis lymphadenectomy; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; sentinel lymph node biopsy; tumor cell; endometrium tumor; immunohistochemistry; pathology; procedures; sentinel lymph node; sentinel lymph node biopsy; very elderly","","BMJ Publishing Group","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076497753"

Methods: The National Cancer Data Base 2006–2015 was queried for patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (stage IA–IIB). Patients were dichotomized into the following two groups, those with 1–14 resected lymph nodes and those with ≥ 15. Optimal number of resected lymph nodes and the effect of lymphadenectomy on survival were assessed using various statistical modeling techniques. Mediation analysis was performed to differentiate the direct and indirect effect of lymph node resection on survival. Results: A total of 21,912 patients were included; median age was 66 years (IQR 59–73), 48.9% were female. Median number of resected lymph nodes was 15 (IQR 10–22), 10,163 (46.4%) had 1–14 and 11,749 (53.6%) had ≥ 15 lymph nodes retrieved. Lymph node positivity increased by 4.1% per lymph node up to eight examined lymph nodes, and by 0.6% per lymph node above eight. Five-year overall survival was 17.9%. Overall survival was better in the ≥ 15 lymph node group (adjusted HR 0.91, CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.001). On a continuous scale, survival improved with increasing LNs collected. Patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and were treated at high-volume centers had improved overall survival compared with their counterparts (adjusted HR 0.59, CI 0.57–0.62, p < 0.001; adjusted HR 0.86, CI 0.83–0.89, p < 0.001, respectively). Mediation analysis revealed that lymphadenectomy had only 18% direct effect on improved overall survival, while 82% of its effect were mediated by other factors like treatment at high-volume hospitals and adjuvant chemotherapy. Discussion: While higher number of resected lymph nodes increases lymph node positivity and is associated with better overall survival, most of the observed survival benefit is mediated by chemotherapy and treatment at high-volume centers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Lymph node; Mediation analysis; National Cancer Data Base; Pancreatic cancer; Surgery; Survival","Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Databases, Factual; Female; Hospitals, High-Volume; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pancreatic Neoplasms; antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; groups by age; high volume hospital; human; human tissue; lymph node; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; middle aged; overall survival; pancreas cancer; pancreatectomy; pancreaticoduodenectomy; predictor variable; priority journal; race difference; sex difference; tumor localization; adenocarcinoma; adjuvant chemotherapy; factual database; high volume hospital; lymph node; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; mortality; pancreas tumor; pathology","","Springer","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079447546"

However, the roles of aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression in the response to HIV infection are not fully understood. We investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles in two HIV-infected T lymphocyte cell lines using high-throughput sequencing. Results: Based on DNA methylation data, we identified 3,060 hypomethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 2,659 hypermethylated DMRs in HIV-infected cells. Transcription-factor-binding motifs were significantly associated with methylation alterations, suggesting that DNA methylation modulates gene expression by affecting the binding to transcription factors during HIV infection. In support of this hypothesis, genes with promoters overlapping with DMRs were enriched in the biological function related to transcription factor activities. Furthermore, the analysis of gene expression data identified 1,633 upregulated genes and 2,142 downregulated genes on average in HIV-infected cells. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in apoptosis-related pathways. Our results suggest alternative splicing as an additional mechanism that may contribute to T-cell apoptosis during HIV infection. We also demonstrated a genome-scale correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression in HIV-infected cells. We identified 831 genes with alterations in both DNA methylation and gene expression, which were enriched in apoptosis. Our results were validated using various experimental methods. In addition, consistent with our in silico results, a luciferase assay showed that the activity of the PDX1 and SMAD3 promoters was significantly decreased in the presence of HIV proteins, indicating the potential of these genes as genetic markers of HIV infection. Conclusions: Our results suggest important roles for DNA methylation and gene expression regulation in T-cell apoptosis during HIV infection. We propose a list of novel genes related to these processes for further investigation. This study also provides a comprehensive characterization of changes occurring at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels in T cells in response to HIV infection. © Copyright © 2020 Zeng, Tsui, Shi, Peng, Cao, Kan, Lau, Liang, Wang, Liu, Chen and Tsui.","apoptosis; DNA methylation; gene expression; genome; HIV infection","Apoptosis; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome; HEK293 Cells; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Smad3 Protein; Trans-Activators; Transcriptional Activation; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA; DNA fragment; genomic DNA; heat shock protein; heat shock protein family A member 5; lymphoid enhancer factor 1; oligonucleotide; Ran protein; Smad3 protein; transcription factor GATA 3; transcription factor PDX 1; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 1; unclassified drug; homeodomain protein; pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein; Smad3 protein; SMAD3 protein, human; transactivator protein; amino acid sequence; apoptosis; Article; bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell survival; CpG island; DNA extraction; DNA methylation; down regulation; epigenetics; gene expression; gene function; gene mutation; genetic transfection; HEK293T cell line; high throughput sequencing; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypothesis; Jurkat cell line; long interspersed nuclear element; long terminal repeat; luciferase assay; MT-2 cell line; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; upregulation; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; genome; HEK293 cell line; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; physiology; promoter region; transcription initiation","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091480957"

We studied 67 children: 42 who developed IA (20 of 42 progressed to diabetes) and 25 control subjects matched for sex and age. Biomarkers were assessed at four time points: Earliest available sample, just prior to IA, just after IA, and just prior to diabetes onset. Predictors of IA and progression to diabetes were identified across disparate sources using an integrative machine learning algorithm and optimization-based feature selection. Our integrative approach was predictive of IA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.91) and progression to diabetes (AUC 0.92) based on standard cross-validation (CV). Among the strongest predictors of IA were change in serum ascorbate, 3-methyl-oxobutyrate, and the PTPN22 (rs2476601) polymorphism. Serum glucose, ADP fibrinogen, and mannose were among the strongest predictors of progression to diabetes. This proof-of-principle analysis is the first study to integrate large, diverse biomarker data sets into a limited number of features, highlighting differences in pathways leading to IA from those predicting progression to diabetes. Integratedmodels, if validated in independent populations, could provide novel clues concerning the pathways leading to IA and type 1 diabetes. © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adenosine Diphosphate; Adolescent; Ascorbic Acid; Autoimmunity; Biomarkers; Butyrates; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Fibrinogen; Humans; Infant; Male; Mannose; Models, Biological; Polymorphism, Genetic; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22; Young Adult; 3 methyl oxobutyrate; adenosine diphosphate; ascorbic acid; biological marker; fibrinogen; glucose; mannose; oxoacid; unclassified drug; adenosine diphosphate; ascorbic acid; biological marker; butyric acid derivative; fibrinogen; mannose; non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 22; PTPN22 protein, human; adolescent; adult; area under the curve; Article; autoimmunity; case control study; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; feature selection; female; genotype; glucose blood level; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; machine learning; male; metabolomics; outcome assessment; pancreas islet autoimmunity; priority journal; proteomics; receiver operating characteristic; autoimmunity; biological model; blood; genetic polymorphism; genetics; immunology; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; preschool child; young adult","","American Diabetes Association Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078380011"

To figure out the structural features, phylogenetic relationships, and expression patterns of MLO genes, we investigated the genome and transcriptome sequencing data of 28 plant species using bioinformatics tools. A total of 197 MLO genes were identified. They possessed 5–7 transmembrane domains, but only partially contained a calmodulin-binding domain. A total of 359 polymorphic sites and 142 haplotypes were found in 143 sequences, indicating the rich nucleotide diversity of MLO genes. The MLO genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes or scaffolds and were mainly located at the ends, forming clusters (24.1% genes), tandem duplicates (5.7%), and segment duplicates (36.2%). The MLO genes could be classified into three groups by phylogenetic analysis. The angiosperm genes were mainly in subgroup IA, Selaginella moellendorffii genes were in subgroup IA and IIIB, Physcomitrella patens genes were in subgroup IB and IIIA, and almost all algae genes were in group II. About half of the MLO genes had homologs within and across species. The Ka/Ks values were all less than 1, varying 0.01–0.78, suggesting that purifying selection had occurred in MLO gene evolution. In tomato, RNA-seq data indicated that SlMLO genes were highly expressed in roots, followed by flowers, buds, and leaves, and also regulated by different biotic stresses. qRT–PCR analysis revealed that SlMLO genes could respond to tomato bacterial wilt, with SlMLO1, SlMLO2, SlMLO4, and SlMLO6 probably involved in the susceptibility response, whereas SlMLO14 and SlMLO16 being the opposite. These results lay a foundation for the isolation and application of related genes in plant disease resistance breeding. © 2020 by the authors.

No studies up to now focus on its applicability and results for the treatment of suprarenal aortic pathologies (SRAP). Hence, we evaluated the clinical and radiologic results of ch-EVAR treatment for SRAP placing three or more chimney grafts within the PERICLES Registry. Methods: Data from 517 patients suffering complex aortic pathologies treated by ch-EVAR between 2008 and 2014 at 13 European and U.S. centers were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: Sixty-seven ch-EVAR-treated patients (12.9% of the entire PERICLES cohort) presented SRAP (83.5% elective, 16.5% urgent). The majority of patients (95.5%) received three chimney grafts; four patients received four chimney grafts. The Endurant device was the most commonly used (35.8%) followed by the Zenith abdominal endograft (19.4%). Overall, 204 chimney grafts were placed (56.7% covered self-expandable, 40.3% covered balloon-expandable stents, and 10.4% bare metal balloon-expandable stents). At a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 0.1-67.0 days), 30-day mortality was 6.1% (4 patients), and the overall mortality was 16.4% (11 patients). Overall survival was 87.4% (range, 79.5%-96.0%) at 1 year, 81.8% (range, 72.2%-92.2%) at 2 years and thereafter. Type IA endoleak was noted in nine patients (13.4%) intraoperatively and successfully treated in seven cases (97.1% technical success). Aneurysm sac diameter significantly decreased from 70.5 ± 19.3 mm to 66.9 ± 20.6 mm (P <.001) at last follow-up. Ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were noted in two patients (2.9%). Chimney occlusion was detected in six renal arteries (9.5%) and two superior mesenteric arteries (3.2%). No patients required chronic hemodialysis. All occluded superior mesenteric artery grafts were successfully rescued using endovascular approaches. Conclusions: The midterm use of ch-EVAR for the treatment SRAP seems to be safe, highlighting its applicability for the treatment of rupture threatening pathologies and seal zone lengthening as in type IA endoleaks after EVAR. However, the incidence of type IA endoleaks, chimney graft occlusions, and ischemic stroke rates is higher compared with the prevailing single chimney evidence. Longer follow-up with more cases is needed to establish the exact performance of this treatment in SRAP. © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery","Complex aneurysms; Multiple chimney EVAR; Superior mesenteric artery; Suprarenal aneurysms; Triple chimney EVAR","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Diseases; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Endovascular Procedures; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Mesenteric Artery, Superior; Postoperative Complications; Prosthesis Design; Registries; Renal Artery; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States; aged; aneurysm diameter; Article; brain ischemia; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; elective surgery; emergency surgery; endoleak; endovascular surgery; Europe; female; follow up; graft occlusion; hospital mortality; human; in-stent restenosis; kidney artery stenosis; major clinical study; male; medical record review; mortality rate; overall survival; priority journal; register; reoperation; retrospective study; superior mesenteric artery obstruction; suprarenal aortic aneurysm; survival; transient ischemic attack; United States; adverse event; aortic disease; blood vessel prosthesis; blood vessel transplantation; clinical trial; devices; diagnostic imaging; endovascular surgery; kidney artery; multicenter study; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; prosthesis design; risk factor; stent; superior mesenteric artery; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly","","Mosby Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073233244"

When cornstarch was first described as a treatment, few people survived beyond early childhood. As the prognosis for this population has improved, the need to ensure appropriate cornstarch dosing for different age groups has become imperative. Records from 115 patients (10-62 years of age) with GSD Ia evaluated at our center between 2015 and 2017 were reviewed. Data collected included weight, age, genetic mutation, amount and frequency of cornstarch doses, body mass index, gender, 24-hour glucose and lactate concentrations, and biochemical markers of metabolic control. The data demonstrate that adult treatment needs vary greatly from younger age groups, and the required cornstarch support decreases with age (P <.001). The required number of doses, however, did not change with a mean of six doses (range 4-8) daily in all age groups. General laboratory findings across time demonstrate that significantly reducing the amount of starch required to maintain euglycemia with aging can be done without sacrificing metabolic control. Carbohydrate requirements decrease with aging, and older patients were found to require less cornstarch. Failure to lower the cornstarch doses contributes to over-treatment in adults with GSD Ia. Not only does this lead to worsening hepatomegaly and excessive weight gain, but over-treatment contributes to relative hyperinsulinism and rebound hypoglycemia. This knowledge is essential in designing nutritional therapies for the aging GSD population. © 2019 SSIEM","adults; cornstarch; glycogen storage disease type Ia; treatment","Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Child; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease Type I; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Starch; United States; Young Adult; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; glucose; lactic acid; starch; triacylglycerol; uric acid; biological marker; starch; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aging; Article; biochemical analysis; body mass; body weight; body weight gain; child; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; diet therapy; drug dose regimen; female; gene mutation; glycogen storage disease type 1; glycogen storage disease type 1a; glycogen storage disease type 1a; hepatomegaly; human; hyperinsulinism; hypoglycemia; major clinical study; male; metabolic regulation; middle aged; retrospective study; school child; sex difference; young adult; blood; clinical trial; glucose blood level; glycogen storage disease type 1; hypoglycemia; metabolism; multicenter study; statistical model; United States","","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071737253"

To elucidate this, we endeavored to estimate the actual turnover rates of the main molecular constituent in human IA (collagen) on the basis of radiocarbon (14C) birth dating in relation to IA hemodynamics. Methods - Collagen turnover rates in excised human IA samples were calculated using mathematical modeling of 14C birth dating data of collagen in relation to risk factors and histological markers for collagen maturity/turnover in selected IA. Hemodynamics were simulated using image-based computational fluid dynamics. Correlation, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed. Results - Collagen turnover rates were estimated in 46 IA (43 patients); computational fluid dynamics could be performed in 20 IA (20 patients). The mean collagen turnover rate (γ) constituted 126% (±1% error) per year. For patients with arterial hypertension, γ was greater than 2600% annually, whereas γ was distinctly lower with 32% (±1% error) per year for patients without risk factors, such as smoking and hypertension. There was a distinct association between histological presence of rather immature collagen in human IA and the presence of modifiable risk factors. Spatial-temporal averaged wall shear stress predicted rapid collagen turnover (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.7]). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a good test accuracy (area under the curve, 0.798 [95% CI, 0.598-0.998]) for average wall shear stress with a threshold ≥4.9 Pa for rapid collagen turnover. Conclusions - Our data indicate that turnover rates and stability of collagen in human IA are strongly associated with the presence of modifiable risk factors and aneurysmal hemodynamics. These findings underline the importance of strict risk factor modification in patients with unruptured IA. Future should include more detailed risk factor data to establish a more causal understanding of hemodynamics and the rupture risk of individual IA. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We have considered up to the third order corrections of this parametrization and investigate the models at the level of background and perturbations. The models have been constrained using the latest astronomical datasets from a series of potential astronomical data, such as the cosmic microwave background observations, baryon acoustic oscillations measurements, recent Pantheon sample of the supernova type Ia and the Hubble parameter measurements. From the analyses we found that all parametrization favor the quintessential character of the dark energy equation of state where the phantom crossing is marginally allowed (within 68% CL).

Although safe and efficacious, it is unclear how oncologic outcomes are impacted by surgical platform. Objective: To identify differences in progression-free survival and overall survival in women undergoing minimally invasive surgery for endometrial cancer staging via either multiport, single-port, or robotic-assisted laparoscopy. Study Design: A multicenter, single-institution retrospective cohort study was performed in women with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer who underwent minimally invasive surgery from 2009 to 2015. Data were collected for demographics, pathologic information, adjuvant treatment, and disease status. Pearson χ2 and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate risk factors for outcomes, Kaplan–Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards were used to evaluate differences in time to progression or death, and multivariate regression analysis was performed. Results: In total, 1150 women with endometrial cancer underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopy (n=652), multiport laparoscopy (n=214), or single-port laparoscopy (n=284). The median age and body mass index of women was 62.0 years and 33.5 kg/m2, respectively. The majority of patients had endometrioid histology (88.1%), stage IA (74.7%) or IB disease (13.1%) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade 1 (57.4%) or 2 (26.0%) histology. Lymphovascular space invasion was present in 24.7% (n=283). Adjuvant radiation was given in 34.2% of cases, with 21.9% receiving vaginal brachytherapy, 6.6% pelvic radiation, and 5.4% both. For the entire cohort, there were no differences in progression-free survival at 2, 3, and 5 years for multiport laparoscopy (94.2%, 91.4%, 87.4%), robotic-assisted laparoscopy (94.5%, 92.9%, 88.8%), and single-port laparoscopy (93.6%, 91.2%, 90.0%) (P=.93), respectively. Similarly, there were no differences in overall survival at 2, 3, and 5 years for multiport laparoscopy (94.4%, 91.8%, 91.8%), robotic-assisted laparoscopy (95.6%, 93.4%, 90.7%), and single-port laparoscopy (95.0, 93.1, 91.8) (P=.99), respectively. Among women with stage IA and IB disease, no difference existed for progression-free survival at 2, 3, and 5 years for multiport laparoscopy (94.2%, 91.4%, 87.4%), robotic-assisted laparoscopy (94.5%, 92.9%, 88.8%), and single-port laparoscopy (93.6, 91.2, 90.0) (P=.93), respectively. Similarly, among women with stage I disease, there was no difference in overall survival at 2, 3, and 5 years for multiport laparoscopy (96.2%, 95.0%, 95.0%), robotic-assisted laparoscopy (96.6%, 95.4%, 93.3%), and single-port laparoscopy (96.6%, 95.0%, 93.4%) (P=.89). Rather, progression-free survival and overall survival were predicted by age >65 years, stage, grade, and histology (P<.05). On multivariate analysis, modality of surgery did not impact overall survival or progression-free survival (robotic-assisted laparoscopy, hazard ratio, 1.28, P=.50; single-port laparoscopy, hazard ratio, 0.84, P=.68 vs multiport laparoscopy). Age >65 years (hazard ratio, 5.42, P<.001) and advanced stage disease (P=.003) were associated with decreased overall survival. Conclusion: In this retrospective cohort, there was no difference in progression-free survival or overall survival in women undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer via robotic-assisted laparoscopy, single-port laparoscopy, or multiport laparoscopy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","endometrial cancer; laparoscopy; minimally invasive surgery; robotic-assisted laparoscopy; single-port laparoscopy","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hysterectomy; Laparoscopy; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; carboplatin; paclitaxel; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; body mass; brachytherapy; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer grading; cancer growth; cancer hormone therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; endometrium cancer; female; human; human cell; laparoscopy; major clinical study; minimally invasive surgery; multiport laparoscopy; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; retrospective study; risk factor; robot assisted surgery; single port laparoscopy; tumor invasion; carcinoma; endometrium tumor; follow up; hysterectomy; laparoscopy; middle aged; mortality; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly","","Mosby Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071638542"

SUMMARY ANSWER: We have demonstrated an effective protocol for decellularization of human ovarian tissues and successful recellularization with isolated human ovarian cells and pre-antral follicles. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Survivors of leukemia or ovarian cancer run a risk of reintroducing malignancy when cryopreserved ovarian tissue is transplanted to restore fertility. A reconstructed ovary free of malignant cells could provide a safe alternative. Decellularization of ovarian tissue removes all cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM) including possible malignancies and leaves behind a physiological scaffold. The ECM offers the complex milieu that facilitates the necessary interaction between ovarian follicles and their surroundings to ensure their growth and development. Previous studies have shown that decellularized bovine ovarian scaffolds supported murine follicle growth and restoration of ovarian function in ovariectomized mice. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Optimizing a decellularization protocol for human ovarian tissues and testing biofunctionality of the decellularized scaffolds in vitro and in vivo by reseeding with both murine and human pre-antral follicles and ovarian cells. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Donated human ovarian tissue and isolated pre-antral follicles were obtained from women undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation. Ovarian cortical and medullary tissues were decellularized using 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 3, 6, 18 and 24 hours followed by 24 hours of 1 mg/mL DNase treatment and washing. Decellularization of ovarian tissues and preservation of ECM were characterized by morphological evaluation using Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, DNA quantification, histochemical quantification of collagen content and immunofluorescence analysis for collagen IA, laminin, fibronectin and DNA. Human ovarian stromal cells and isolated human pre-antral follicles were reseeded on the DCT and cultured in vitro. Isolated murine (N = 241) and human (N = 20) pre-antral follicles were reseeded on decellularized scaffolds and grafted subcutaneously to immunodeficient mice for 3 weeks. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Incubation in 0.1% SDS for 18-24 hours adequately decellularized both human ovarian medullary and cortical tissue by eliminating all cells and leaving the ECM intact. DNA content in DCT was decreased by >90% compared to native tissue samples. Histological examination using PAS staining confirmed that the cortical and medullary tissues were completely decellularized, and no visible nuclear material was found within the decellularized sections. DCT also stained positive for collagen I and collagen quantities in DCT constituted 88-98% of the individual baselines for native samples. Human ovarian stroma cells were able to recellularize the DCT and isolated human pre-antral follicles remained viable in co-culture. Xenotransplantation of DCT reseeded with human or murine pre-antral follicles showed, that the DCT was able to support survival of human follicles and growth of murine follicles, of which 39% grew to antral stages. The follicular recovery rates after three weeks grafting were low but similar for both human (25%) and murine follicles (21%). LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Further studies are needed to increase recovery and survival of the reseeded follicles. Longer grafting periods should be evaluated to determine the developmental potential of human follicles. Survival of the follicles might be impaired by the lack of stroma cells. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first time that isolated human follicles have survived in a decellularized human scaffold. Therefore, this proof-of-concept could be a potential new strategy to eliminate the risk of malignant cell re-occurrence in former cancer patients having cryopreserved ovarian tissue transplanted for fertility restoration.

We conducted a pilot study to determine the prevalence of GBS among pregnant women in Amman, Jordan, where GBS testing is not routine. We also explored GBS serotypes and the performance of a rapid GBS antigen diagnostic test. Methods: We collected vaginal-rectal swabs from women who presented for labor and delivery at Al-Bashir Hospital. Three methods were used to identify GBS: Strep B Rapid Test (Creative Diagnostics), blood agar media (Remel) with confirmed with BBL Streptocard acid latex test (Becton Dickinson), and CHROMagar StrepB (Remel). Results were read by a senior microbiologist. We defined our gold standard for GBS-positive as a positive blood agar culture confirmed by latex agglutination and positive CHROMagar. PCR testing determined serotype information. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. Results: In April and May 2015, 200 women were enrolled with a median age of 27 years (IQR: 23-32); 89.0% were Jordanian nationals and 71.9% completed secondary school. Median gestational age was 38 weeks (IQR: 37-40); most women reported prenatal care (median 9 visits; IQR: 8-12). Median parity was 2 births (IQR: 1-3). Pre-pregnancy median BMI was 24.1 (IQR: 21.5-28.0) and 14.5% reported an underlying medical condition. Obstetric complications included gestational hypertension (9.5%), gestational diabetes (6.0%), and UTI (53.5%), of which 84.5% reported treatment. Overall, 39 (19.5%) of women were GBS-positive on blood agar media and CHROMagar, while 67 (33.5%) were positive by rapid test (36% sensitivity, 67% specificity). Serotype information was available for 25 (64%) isolates: III (48%), Ia (24%), II (20%), and V (8%). No demographic or clinical differences were noted between GBS+ and GBS-negative women. Conclusions: Nearly one in five women presenting for labor in Jordan was colonized with GBS, with serotype group III as the most common. The rapid GBS antigen diagnostic had low sensitivity and specificity. These results support expanded research in the region, including defining GBS resistance patterns, serotyping information, and risk factors. It also emphasizes the need for routine GBS testing and improved rapid GBS diagnostics for developing world settings. © 2019 The Author(s).","GBS; Group B Streptococcus; Jordan; Middle East; Pregnancy","Adult; Female; Humans; Jordan; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prevalence; Rectum; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serogroup; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus agalactiae; Vagina; Young Adult; agar; antibiotic agent; adolescent; adult; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterium isolate; blood culture; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; gestational age; gold standard; group B streptococcal infection; high school; human; Jordan; Jordanian; labor; latex agglutination test; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; microbiological examination; nonhuman; obstetric delivery; parity; pilot study; polymerase chain reaction; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; prenatal care; prevalence; sensitivity and specificity; serotype; Streptococcus agalactiae; urinary tract infection; young adult; isolation and purification; microbiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prevalence; rectum; Streptococcus agalactiae; Streptococcus infection; vagina","","BioMed Central Ltd.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066444078"

To advance towards more precise treatments in radiotherapy, we queried the lung CT-derived feature space to identify radiation sensitivity parameters that can predict treatment failure and hence guide the individualisation of radiotherapy dose. Methods: An institutional review board-approved study (IRB 14-562) was used to identify patients treated with lung stereotactic body radiotherapy. Patients with primary (stage IA–IV) or recurrent lung cancer and patients with other cancer types with solitary metastases or oligometastases to the lung were included. Patients without digitally accessible CT image or radiotherapy structure data were excluded. The internal study cohort received treatment at the main campus of the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH, USA). The independent validation cohort received treatment at seven affiliate regional or national sites. We input pre-therapy lung CT images into Deep Profiler, a multi-task deep neural network that has radiomics incorporated into the training process, to generate an image fingerprint that predicts time-to-event treatment outcomes and approximates classical radiomic features. We validated our findings with the independent study cohort. Deep Profiler was combined with clinical variables to derive iGray, an individualised dose that estimates treatment failure probability to be below 5%. Findings: A total of 1275 patients were assessed for eligibility and 944 met our eligibility criteria; 849 were in the internal study cohort and 95 were in the independent validation cohort. Radiation treatments in patients with high Deep Profiler scores failed at a significantly higher rate than in patients with low scores; 3-year cumulative incidence of local failure in the internal study cohort was 20·3% (16·0–24·9) in patients with high Deep Profiler scores and 5·7% (95% CI 3·5–8·8) in patients with low Deep Profiler scores (hazard ratio [HR]=3·64 [95% CI 2·19–6·05], p<0·0001). Deep Profiler independently predicted local failure (HR=1·65 [1·02–2·66], p=0·042). Models that included Deep Profiler and clinical variables predicted treatment failures with a concordance index (C-index) of 0·72 (95% CI 0·67–0·77), a significant improvement compared with classical radiomics (p<0·0001) or clinical variables (p<0·0001) alone. Deep Profiler performed well in the independent validation cohort, predicting treatment failures across diverse clinical settings and CT scanner types (C-index 0·77, 95% CI 0·69–0·92). iGray had a wide dose range (21·1–277 Gy) and suggested dose reductions in 23·3% of patients. Our results also showed that iGray can be safely delivered in the majority of cases. Interpretation: Our results indicate that there are image-distinct subpopulations that have differential sensitivity to radiotherapy. The image-based deep learning framework proposed herein is the first opportunity to use medical images to individualise radiotherapy dose. Our results signify a new roadmap for deep learning-guided predictions and treatment guidance in the image-replete and highly standardised discipline of radiation oncology.

While rare in humans, it usually causes severe illness, including bacteremia. In the United States, Salmonella Dublin has become one of the most multidrug-resistant (MDR) serotypes. To understand the genetic elements that are associated with virulence and resistance, we sequenced 61 isolates of Salmonella Dublin (49 from sick cattle and 12 from retail beef) using the Illumina MiSeq and closed 5 genomes using the PacBio sequencing platform. Genomic data of eight human isolates were also downloaded from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) for comparative analysis. Fifteen Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) and a spv operon (spvRABCD), which encodes important virulence factors, were identified in all 69 (100%) isolates. The 15 SPIs were located on the chromosome of the 5 closed genomes, with each of these isolates also carrying 1 or 2 plasmids with sizes between 36 and 329 kb. Multiple antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), including blaCMY-2, blaTEM-1B, aadA12, aph(3′)-Ia, aph(3′)-Ic, strA, strB, floR, sul1, sul2, and tet(A), along with spv operons were identified on these plasmids. Comprehensive antimicrobial resistance genotypes were determined, including 17 genes encoding resistance to 5 different classes of antimicrobials, and mutations in the housekeeping gene (gyrA) associated with resistance or decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Together these data revealed that this panel of Salmonella Dublin commonly carried 15 SPIs, MDR/virulence plasmids, and ARGs against several classes of antimicrobials. Such genomic elements may make important contributions to the severity of disease and treatment failures in Salmonella Dublin infections in both humans and cattle. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","antimicrobial resistance; MDR plasmid; pathogenicity islands; Salmonella Dublin","Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cattle; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Genomic Islands; Genomics; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plasmids; Red Meat; Salmonella; Salmonella Infections, Animal; United States; Virulence; Virulence Factors; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A; quinolone derivative; virulence plasmid; antiinfective agent; virulence factor; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistome; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium isolation; beef; bovine; chromosome; housekeeping gene; microbial diversity; nonhuman; operon; pathogenicity island; plasmid; priority journal; Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; United States; animal; animal salmonellosis; drug effect; genetics; genomic island; genomics; human; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; multidrug resistance; procedures; red meat; Salmonella; virulence","","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073182925"

We assessed the diagnostic utility of CT assessment in patients with hematologic malignancies or those who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in whom invasive aspergillosis was suspected. Methods: This post-hoc analysis assessed data from a prospective, multicenter, international trial of voriconazole (with and without anidulafungin) in patients with suspected invasive aspergillosis (IA; proven, probable, or possible, using 2008 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria) [NCT00531479]. Eligible patients received at least one baseline lung CT scan. Results: Of 395 patients included in this post-hoc analysis, 240 patients (60.8%) had 'confirmed' proven (9/240, 3.8%) or probable (231/240, 96.3%) invasive aspergillosis (cIA) and 155 patients (39.2%) had 'non-confirmed' invasive aspergillosis (all nIA; all possible IA (de Pauw et al., Clin Infect Dis 46:1813-21, 2008)). Mean age was 52.3 and 50.5 years, 56.3 and 60.0% of patients were male, and most patients were white (71.7 and 71.0%) in the cIA and nIA populations, respectively. Median baseline galactomannan was 1.4 (cIA) and 0.2 (nIA), mean Karnofsky score was 65.3 (cIA) and 66.8 (nIA), and mean baseline platelet count was 48.0 (cIA) and 314.1 (nIA). Pulmonary nodules (46.8% of all patients), bilateral lung lesions (37.5%), unilateral lung lesions (28.4%), and consolidation (24.8%) were the most common radiographic abnormalities. Ground-glass attenuation (cIA: 24.2%; nIA: 11.6%; P < 0.01) and pulmonary nodules (cIA: 52.5%; nIA: 38.1%; P < 0.01) were associated with cIA. Other chest CT scan abnormalities (including halo signs and air-crescent signs) at baseline in patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and suspected IA, were not associated with cIA. Conclusions: These findings highlight the limitations in the sensitivity of chest CT scans for the diagnosis of IA, and reinforce the importance of incorporating other available clinical data to guide management decisions on individual patients, including whether empirical treatment is reasonable, pending full evaluation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Antifungal treatment; Computed tomography scans; Diagnosis; Hematologic malignancy; Hematopoietic stem cell transplant; Invasive aspergillosis; Radiographic abnormalities","Adult; Anidulafungin; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis; Karnofsky Performance Status; Lung; Male; Mannans; Middle Aged; Platelet Count; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Voriconazole; anidulafungin; galactomannan; voriconazole; anidulafungin; galactomannan; mannan; voriconazole; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; Caucasian; clinical effectiveness; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic value; double blind procedure; female; gender; hematologic malignancy; human; invasive aspergillosis; Karnofsky Performance Status; lung lesion; lung nodule; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multicenter study; phase 3 clinical trial; platelet count; post hoc analysis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; blood; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; hematologic disease; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; invasive aspergillosis; lung; microbiology; mortality; pathology; procedures; x-ray computed tomography","","BioMed Central Ltd.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066398670"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between tumor size and prognosis in patients with T1 ICC. The data regarding patients with ICC was downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between January 2004 and December 2013, at the time of first diagnosis and entered into the database. Demographic and pathological characteristics of patients were analyzed using an independent t-test and χ2 test. Overall survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis; the cut-off point for tumor size was determined using the X-tile software. A total of 407 patients with ICC were selected from the analysis, including 199 cases with stage IA and 208 cases with stage IB tumors. The independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IA ICC were age and surgery. Independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IB ICC included age, surgery (yes vs. no) and tumor size (5-7 vs. ≥7 cm). The optimal cut-off value for tumor size was determined to be ~7 cm using X-tile software. Tumor size with a cut-off value of 7 cm could stratify patients by risk better than a value of 5 cm [hazard ratio (HR), 1.775; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.356-2.323 and; HR, 1.402; 95% CI, 1.078-1.824, respectively]. This suggests that the T1 tumor category should be subclassified into T1a and T1b with a cut-off of 7 cm rather than 5 cm. The next edition of the AJCC staging system may take the present evidence into consideration for improvement regarding the accurate staging of ICC. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate screening, elective treatment, and the rate of SAH in patients with known PKD. METHODS: We examined longitudinally linked claims data from a large private insurer, identifying screening, elective treatment, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and secured aneurysmal SAH (saSAH) in 2004 to 2014 amongst patients with known PKD. RESULTS: We identified 20 704 patients diagnosed with PKD. Among patients with an initial PKD diagnosis, 51/446 (15.9%) underwent angiographic screening within 2 yr. Forty aneurysms were treated electively in 48 868 yr at risk in PKD patients (82/100K patient yr, 95% confidence interval [CI] 60-112) vs 24 elective treatments in 349 861 yr at risk in age- and sex-matched controls (7/100K patient yr, 95% CI 5-10, P <. 0001). Eleven admissions for aSAH were identified in PKD patients (23/100K patient yr, 95% CI 13-41) and 22 admissions for aSAH in controls (6/100K patient yr, 95% CI 4-10), giving an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.6 (95% CI 1.7-7.4, P <. 0001) and a comorbidity-adjusted IRR of 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.9). The incidence of saSAH was proportionally even higher in PKD patients than controls, 16 vs 2/100K patient years, IRR 9.5 (95% CI 3.3-27.5, P <. 0001). CONCLUSION: Screening in PKD is performed only selectively, though resulting rates of elective treatment were over 10× those of controls. Despite screening and treatment, the rate of SAH remains significantly elevated over that of controls. © 2018 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD); Cerebral aneurysm; Intracranial aneurysm (IA); Polycystic kidney disease (PKD); Screening; Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)","Adult; Aged; Aneurysm, Ruptured; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; United States; adult; aneurysm surgery; Article; brain angiography; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; digital subtraction angiography; elective surgery; end stage renal disease; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; hospital admission; hospital readmission; human; incidence; kidney polycystic disease; longitudinal study; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; open surgery; priority journal; private health insurance; retrospective study; screening test; secured aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; subarachnoid hemorrhage; adverse event; aged; aneurysm rupture; complication; elective surgery; hospitalization; intracranial aneurysm; kidney polycystic disease; mass screening; subarachnoid hemorrhage; United States","","Oxford University Press","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069802227"

We attempted to assess PTS as a prognosticator for overall survival (OS) in CS IA seminoma and to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of active surveillance (AS) versus adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with large primary tumors (LPT). Methods and materials: In the National Cancer Database (2004–2014), 2455 (47.7%) and 2685 (52.3%) patients with CS IA seminoma were treated with AS and AT, respectively. AT was defined as the receipt of chemotherapy or radiation within 3 months after orchiectomy. A cut-point analysis was performed to determine the optimal PTS threshold predicting OS at 5 years after orchiectomy. Inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were used to compare OS of patients with LPT (using the optimal PTS cut-point) treated with AS versus AT. Results: In adjusted analysis, pathologic T-stage (pT1a vs. pT1b) did not predict OS and no OS benefit was noted in pT1b patients treated with AT. The optimal PTS cut-point was 4.5 cm. In multivariable analysis, patients with LPT (≥4.5 cm) had an increased risk of overall mortality (HR = 1.87, P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that OS was superior in patients with LPT treated with AT (IPTW-adjusted log-rank P = 0.029). In IPTW-adjusted Cox regression analysis, AT was associated with an OS benefit in patients with LPT (HR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.39–0.91, P = 0.017). Conclusions: In this National Cancer Database analysis, PTS was a predictor of OS in CS IA seminoma. An OS benefit was noted for individuals with LPT (defined as PTS ≥4.5 cm) managed with AT.

This study shows that the encoder signal, after appropriate processing, can also be efficiently utilized for the health observation of energy performance of industrial robots system. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and Hilbert transform (HT) is proposed in this work, for detecting weak position oscillations to estimate the instantaneous amplitudes (IA) and the instantaneous frequencies (IF) of an industrial robot based on the encoder signal. Compared with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and HT, the singular spectrum analysis and Hilbert transform (SSAHT) outperforms empirical mode decomposition Hilbert transform (EMDHT) in terms of ability and precision to determine source noise, and it can accurately catch the weak oscillations without signal deformation in both position and speed introduced via mechanical flaws. Combined with SSA, the IA and IF of both oscillations and residual are extracted by HT. They are obtained from the robot arm movement. These features play an important role in improving the performance detecting weak oscillations and the residual, essential information to evaluate the health conditions and fault detection to serve the energy performance for the industrial robot. The efficiency of the proposed system has been verified both numerical simulation and experimental data. The outcomes prove that the proposed SSAHT can detect flaw indications and additionally, it can also identify faulty components. Thus, the study presents a promising tool for the health monitoring of an industrial robot instead of the vibration-based monitoring scheme. © 2019 by the authors.","Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Hilbert transform (HT); Industrial robot; Rotary encoder; Singular spectrum analysis (SSA)","Energy efficiency; Health; Industrial robots; Mathematical transformations; Signal encoding; Spectrum analysis; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Fault detection systems; Hilbert transform; Instantaneous amplitude; Instantaneous frequency; Rotary encoder; Singular spectrum analysis; Vibration-based monitoring; Fault detection","","MDPI AG","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069560927"

IAs represent a potential solution for providing older adults with individualized assistance at home, for example, to reduce social isolation, serve as memory aids, or help with disease management. However, to design IAs for health that are beneficial and accepted by older adults, it is important to understand their beliefs about IAs, how they would like to interact with IAs for consumer health, and how they desire to integrate IAs into their homes. Objective: We explore older adults' mental models and beliefs about IAs, the tasks they want IAs to support, and how they would like to interact with IAs for consumer health. For the purpose of this study, we focus on IAs in the context of consumer health information management and search. Methods: We present findings from an exploratory, qualitative study that investigated older adults' perspectives of IAs that aid with consumer health information search and management tasks. Eighteen older adults participated in a multiphase, participatory design workshop in which we engaged them in discussion, brainstorming, and design activities that helped us identify their current challenges managing and finding health information at home. We also explored their beliefs and ideas for an IA to assist them with consumer health tasks. We used participatory design activities to identify areas in which they felt IAs might be useful, but also to uncover the reasoning behind the ideas they presented. Discussions were audio-recorded and later transcribed. We compiled design artifacts collected during the study to supplement researcher transcripts and notes. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data. Results: We found that participants saw IAs as potentially useful for providing recommendations, facilitating collaboration between themselves and other caregivers, and for alerts of serious illness. However, they also desired familiar and natural interactions with IAs (eg, using voice) that could, if need be, provide fluid and unconstrained interactions, reason about their symptoms, and provide information or advice. Other participants discussed the need for flexible IAs that could be used by those with low technical resources or skills. Conclusions: From our findings, we present a discussion of three key components of participants' mental models, including the people, behaviors, and interactions they described that were important for IAs for consumer health information management and seeking. We then discuss the role of access, transparency, caregivers, and autonomy in design for addressing participants' concerns about privacy and trust as well as its role in assisting others that may interact with an IA on the older adults' behalf. © Aqueasha Martin-Hammond, Sravani Vemireddy, Kartik Rao.

Research Question: The implications of babywearing on lower extremity joint moments of the caregiver are still unknown during prolonged transport and a direct comparison of babywearing to carrying an infant in-arms has not been previously conducted. Methods: Eighteen females participated in this study by performing 3 conditions: a) 3 min walking unloaded (UL), b) 15 min walking while carrying a mannequin infant in-arms (IA), and c) 15 min walking while wearing a mannequin infant in an anteriorly positioned baby carrier (BC). Two separate data analyses were conducted using a repeated measures ANOVA. First, UL compared to the initial minute of walking for IA and BC. Second, UL compared to the final minute of walking for IA and BC. Results: During initial minute comparisons, both IA and BC conditions increased joint moments in the frontal and sagittal plane at the knee with no change at the ankle and hip. During final minute comparisons, IA maintained the increases in the knee frontal plane joint moments observed during initial minute comparisons but also increased at the hip; however, BC generally showed no statistical difference from UL. Carrying an infant in a baby carrier more closely resembles unloaded walking, while carrying an infant in-arms appears to increase the mechanical load placed on the knee and hip joints in the frontal plane through an increase in joint moments. Significance: During prolonged transportation, caregivers might choose to employ a baby carrier as opposed to carrying an infant in-arms, as in-arm carriage increases the loading knee abduction moment by 8.7% and the loading knee extension moment by 16.7%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anterior load; Infant carrying; Kinetics; Lower extremity; Walking gait","Adult; Ankle Joint; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Hip Joint; Humans; Infant; Infant Care; Knee Joint; Walking; Weight-Bearing; abduction; adult; ankle; Article; caregiver; female; hip; human; human experiment; knee; normal human; priority journal; walking; weight bearing; ankle; biomechanics; comparative study; hip; infant; infant care; knee; physiology; procedures; weight bearing","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062809675"

However, data regarding the role of adjuvant therapy in early LCNEC are limited. This National Cancer Database (NCDB) analysis was performed to improve the evidence guiding adjuvant therapy for early LCNEC. Methods: Overall survival (OS) of patients with pathologic T1-2a N0 M0 LCNEC who underwent resection in the NCDB from 2003 to 2015 was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery and with more than R0 resection were excluded. Results: Of 2642 patients meeting study criteria, 481 (18%) received adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IB patients was associated with a significant increase in OS (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.90). However, there was no significant difference in survival between adjuvant chemotherapy and no adjuvant therapy for stage IA LCNEC (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.11). Adjuvant radiotherapy, whether alone or combined with chemotherapy, was not associated with a change in OS. In subgroup analysis, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy after lobar resection for stage IB LCNEC had a significant survival benefit compared with patients not receiving adjuvant therapy. Conclusions: In early-stage LCNEC, adjuvant chemotherapy appears to confer an additional overall survival advantage only in patients with completely resected stage IB LCNEC and not for patients with completely resected stage IA LCNEC. © 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","","Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Large Cell; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pneumonectomy; Puerto Rico; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; United States; antineoplastic agent; adjuvant radiotherapy; adult; article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; controlled study; female; human; lung; major clinical study; male; overall survival; adjuvant chemotherapy; aged; cancer staging; carcinoma; clinical trial; epidemiology; follow up; large cell carcinoma; lung resection; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; procedures; Puerto Rico; retrospective study; survival rate; treatment outcome; United States","","Elsevier USA","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068253942"

Recent studies have highlighted its role in inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation and tumor suppression. However, the role of HNF4α in liver regeneration (LR) is not known. We hypothesized that hepatocytes modulate HNF4α activity when navigating between differentiated and proliferative states during LR. Western blotting analysis revealed a rapid decline in nuclear and cytoplasmic HNF4α protein levels, accompanied with decreased target gene expression, within 1 hour after two-thirds partial hepatectomy (post-PH) in C57BL/6J mice. HNF4α protein expression did not recover to pre-PH levels until day 3. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of HNF4α (HNF4α-KO [knockout]) in mice resulted in 100% mortality post-PH, despite increased proliferative marker expression throughout regeneration. Sustained loss of HNF4α target gene expression throughout regeneration indicated that HNF4α-KO mice were unable to compensate for loss of HNF4α transcriptional activity. Deletion of HNF4α resulted in sustained proliferation accompanied by c-Myc and cyclin D1 overexpression and a complete deficiency of hepatocyte function after PH. Interestingly, overexpression of degradation-resistant HNF4α in hepatocytes delayed, but did not prevent, initiation of regeneration after PH. Finally, adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated reexpression of HNF4α in hepatocytes of HNF4α-KO mice post-PH restored HNF4α protein levels, induced target gene expression, and improved survival of HNF4α-KO mice post-PH. Conclusion: In conclusion, these data indicate that HNF4α reexpression following initial decrease is critical for hepatocytes to exit from cell cycle and resume function during the termination phase of LR. These results indicate the role of HNF4α in LR and have implications for therapy of liver failure. © 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","","Animals; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4; Hepatocytes; Liver Regeneration; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; apolipoprotein A2; apolipoprotein B; beta defensin 1; bilirubin; blood clotting factor 12; carboxylesterase; carboxylesterase 3; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA; claudin 1; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cytochrome P450 family 2; cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily c polypeptide 37; glucuronosyltransferase; glucuronosyltransferase 2B1; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha; iodide peroxidase; iodothyronine deiodinase 1; sodium phosphate cotransporter 2b; unclassified drug; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; Adeno associated virus 8; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; bilirubin blood level; C57BL 6 mouse; cell activation; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; densitometry; gene deletion; gene expression; gene overexpression; gene targeting; liver cell; liver regeneration; liver weight; male; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; partial hepatectomy; priority journal; protein expression level; protein processing; transcription regulation; Western blotting; animal; C57BL mouse; liver regeneration; physiology","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062801413"

We asked the following questions: (1) What is the epidemiology of IA HA use in knee arthroplasty (KA) patients? (2) Is Synvisc associated with a delay to KA? (3) Is there a difference in the delay to KA with the number of HA courses? Design: The Optum Clinformatics data set (2006–June 2016) was used to identify patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Patients who did not receive IA HA were identified, along with those who received Synvisc or non-Synvisc HA. The median duration from knee OA to KA was compared using quantile regression modeling with propensity score weighting. The trend in time to KA with each HA course was evaluated. Results: Of 4,027,848 knee OA patients, 141,305 patients underwent KA. Overall median time from knee OA diagnosis to KA was 1.2 years (average: 1.9 ± 1.9 years; interquartile range of 0.4-2.8 years). HA patients had significantly longer adjusted median time to KA by at least 7 months (P < 0.001). After adjusting for the time to HA and number of injections, Synvisc patients had 1.7 months longer time to KA than non-Synvisc HA patients (P < 0.001). There was a trend toward longer time to KA with more HA courses. Conclusions: Most KA patients did not use HA (73.7%) and when received, it was associated with a longer median time to KA by at least 7 months, though the cause and effect could not be examined. The delay to KA increased with more HA courses. © The Author(s) 2018.","hyaluronic acid; intra-articular; knee arthroplasty; knee osteoarthritis","Adult; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Biocompatible Materials; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Utilization; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Injections, Intra-Articular; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; United States; Viscosupplementation; Viscosupplements; Young Adult; hyaluronic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; biomaterial; hyaluronic acid; hylan; viscosupplement; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; delayed diagnosis; echography; female; fluoroscopy; follow up; human; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; knee osteoarthritis; knee pain; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; outcome assessment; physiotherapy; propensity score; retrospective study; risk factor; drug administration; drug utilization; intraarticular drug administration; Kaplan Meier method; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; procedures; time factor; United States; viscosupplementation; young adult","","SAGE Publications Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047382437"

Methods: We screened a total of 9539 patients with resected stage IA-IIIB non-small cell cancer between 2010 and 2015 from SEER database. The chi-square test was used to compare patient baseline characteristics and the X-tile model was applied to determine cut-off values for the number of PLN (nN). The X-tile model was used to screen three different cut-off values including nN = 0, nN1-3 and nN4-. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the influence of different variables on overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were used to compare survival differences. Results: Based on the nN cutoffs, we conducted the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. The result showed that nN stage was a significant prognostic factor affecting patients' OS (all P < 0.001). We reclassified the seventh edition TNM stages of the enrolled patients with stage IA-IIIB NSCLC according to the 5-year OS rate. Hypothesized TNM substage based on the location and the number of PLN was further calculated. Then we drew survival curves for each substage, including for the current TNM stage and the hypothesized TNM stage. From the comparison of survival curves, we found that the survival curve of each substage of the hypothesized TNM classification was proportional and well distributed compared with the current TNM classification (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Revised TNM staging integrating locational pN stage and numerical nN stage was a more accurate prognostic determinant in patients with NSCLC. © 2019 The Author(s).","","Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Chi-Square Distribution; Data Accuracy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung Neoplasms; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; Survival Rate; aged; Article; cancer staging; chi square test; controlled study; female; human; Kaplan Meier method; log rank test; lymph node; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; prognosis; proportional hazards model; univariate analysis; cancer registry; cancer staging; chi square distribution; follow up; lung tumor; lymph node; lymph node metastasis; measurement accuracy; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; prognosis; retrospective study; survival rate","","BioMed Central Ltd.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067432146"

Accurate estimation of radiation dose requires multiple time point measurements using radionuclide imaging modalities such as SPECT or PET. In this report, we show our technical development of reducing the number of scans needed for reasonable estimation of tumor and normal organ dose in our pretherapy imaging and dosimetry platform of 124I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for 131I-MIBG therapy of neuroblastoma. Methods: We analyzed the simplest kinetic data, areas of two-time point data for five patients with neuroblastoma who underwent 3 or 4 times of 124I-MIBG PET/CT scan prior to 131I-MIBG therapy. The data for which we derived areas were percent of injected activity (%IA) and standardized uptake value of tumors. These areas were correlated with time-integrated activity coefficients (TIACs) from full data (3 or 4 time points). TIACs are direct correlates with radiation dose as long as the volume and the radionuclide are known. Results: The areas of %IAs between data obtained from all the two-time points with time points 1 and 2 (day 0 and day 1), time points 2 and 3 (day 1 and day 2), and time points 1 and 3 (day 0 and day 2) showed reasonable correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient |r| > 0.5) with not only tumor and organ TIACs but also tumor and organ absorbed doses. The tumor and organ doses calculated using %IA areas of time point 1 and time point 2 were our best fits at about 20% individual percent difference compared to doses calculated using 3 or 4 time points. Conclusions: We could achieve reasonable accuracy of estimating tumor doses for subsequent radiopharmaceutical therapy using only the two-time point imaging sessions. Images obtained from these time points (within the 48-h after administration of radiopharmaceutical) were also viewed as useful for diagnostic reading. Although our analysis was specific to 124I-MIBG PET/CT pretherapy imaging data for 131I-MIBG therapy of neuroblastoma and the number of imaging datasets was not large, this feasible methodology would generally be applicable to other imaging and therapeutic radionuclides with an appropriate data analysis similar to our analysis to other imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","dosimetry; MIBG; neuroblastoma; radionuclide therapy; tumor dosimetry","3-Iodobenzylguanidine; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Male; Neuroblastoma; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Radiometry; Radiotherapy Dosage; Safety; Young Adult; Correlation methods; Diagnosis; Dosimetry; Large dataset; Patient treatment; Positron emission tomography; Radioisotopes; Single photon emission computed tomography; (3 iodobenzyl)guanidine i 131; metaiodobenzylguanidine i 124; radiopharmaceutical agent; unclassified drug; (3 iodobenzyl)guanidine; Iodine-131; radioactive iodine; Integrated activities; Metaiodobenzylguanidine; Neuroblastomas; Organ dose; Positron emission tomography/computed tomographies; Radionuclide therapy; Technical notes; Time points; Tumor dose; Tumor dosimetry; adolescent; adult; Article; child; clinical article; correlational study; dose calculation; feasibility study; human; neuroblastoma; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; radiation dose; radioisotope therapy; standardized uptake value; diagnostic imaging; female; male; neuroblastoma; radiometry; radiotherapy dosage; safety; young adult; Tumors","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062889190"

Although originally developed for engineering design for extreme rainfall events, its flexibility, its basis in soils and land use, and its history of accepted use have encouraged adaptation and adjustment to the continuous daily time-step models needed for TMDL evaluations. The original event-based CN model itself, background assumptions, improvements, problems, and evolved usage are described. Included are the roles of the initial abstraction ratio (Ia S), antecedent conditions (ARC), the limits of application with different land types, model sensitivity, effects of land slope, and seasonality. Inconsistencies and recent improvements are stressed, including (1) the adjustment of the abstraction coefficient Ia S to 0.05 from the traditional value of 0.20; (2) awareness of the nonapplicability of the CN method in all cases and the preferred use of distributed/weighted runoffs from an array of CN source areas over the use of runoffs from averages CNs; and (3) use of local data and on-site inspections for calibration and perspective. The application of CN-based watershed hydrology models for TMDL studies should be conducted cautiously because it can produce a biased estimation of hydrograph components in certain soils and landscapes. Model parameter calibration in the application of CN method for continuous simulations of TMDLs is strongly suggested. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","Abstracting; Calibration; Land use; Rain; Watersheds; Biased estimation; Continuous simulation; Engineering design; Model sensitivity; On-site inspection; Total maximum daily load; Traditional values; Watershed hydrology; extreme event; precipitation intensity; rainfall-runoff modeling; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; watershed; Runoff","","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065012287"

However, much remains unknown about PUVA's therapeutic mechanisms, optimal duration and frequency of treatment, dose escalation, or use as maintenance therapy. Objectives: To evaluate low-dose, low-frequency PUVA, and whether maintenance treatment extends disease-free remission in patients with mycosis fungoides. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective randomized clinical trial with defined PUVA dosing regimen was carried out in 5 centers (Graz, Vienna, Hietzing, Innsbruck, and Salzburg) across Austria. Patients with stage IA to IIA mycosis fungoides (n = 27) were enrolled in the study beginning March 13, 2013, with the last patient enrolled March 21, 2016. These patients were treated with oral 8-methoxypsoralen followed by UV-A exposure 2 times per week for 12 to 24 weeks until CR. Patients with CR were randomized to PUVA maintenance for 9 months (14 total exposures) or no maintenance. The study was conducted from April 27, 2012, to July 27, 2018. Data analysis of the primary end point was of the intention-to-treat population, and the secondary end point analysis was of the evaluable population. Main Outcomes and Measures: Efficacy of the PUVA regimen was determined by the rate of CR as defined by a modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) score reduction to 0. Levels of proinflammatory molecules in serum and histologic features and percentage of clonal T cells in skin were assessed to search for biomarkers of clinical response. Results: In 27 patients with mycosis fungoides, 19 (70%) were male with mean (range) age 61 (30-80) years. At baseline, patients with CR had a mean (range) mSWAT score of 18.6 (1-47) compared with 16.8 (3-46) in patients with partial response. The 12- to 24-week PUVA induction regimen reduced the mSWAT score in all patients and led to CR in 19 (70%) of 27 patients and a low mean cumulative UV-A dose of 78.5 J/cm2. The subsequent standardized 9-month PUVA maintenance phase prolonged median (range) disease-free remission from 4 (1-20) months to 15 (1-54) months (P =.02). High density of histologic infiltrate and high percentage of clonal TCR sequences in skin biopsy specimens at baseline were inversely associated with therapeutic response. No severe adverse effects were seen during the PUVA induction or maintenance phase. Conclusions and Relevance: This proof-of-concept study identifies potential biomarkers for therapeutic response to PUVA in mycosis fungoides; it also demonstrates that low-dose, low-frequency PUVA appears to be highly effective, and maintenance treatment may extend disease-free remission.

However, due to population heterogeneity, whether these loci are associated with IA pathogenesis in Chinese individuals is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations among GWAS-identified loci and risk of IA in a Chinese population. Materials and Methods: A total of 765 individuals (including 230 IA patients and 535 controls) were involved in this study. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of candidate loci were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Associations were analyzed using univariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: SNPs in CDKN2B-AS1 (especially rs10757272) showed significant associations with IA in dominant and additive models [odds ratio (OR), 2.99 and 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.44–6.24 and 1.10–1.86, respectively]. A SNP near HDAC9 (rs10230207) was associated with IA in the dominant model (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.01–1.99).

No associations were observed among common variants near EDNRA, SOX17, or RBBP8 and IA. Conclusion: These data partially confirmed earlier results and showed that variants in CDKN2B-AS1, RP1, and HDAC9 could be genetic susceptibility factors for IA in a Chinese population. © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.","Genetic polymorphisms; Intracranial aneurysm; Susceptibility genes","Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B; endothelin A receptor; genomic DNA; histone deacetylase 9; retinoblastoma binding protein; transcription factor Sox; Article; CDKN2B AS1 gene; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; digital subtraction angiography; DNA extraction; EDNRA gene; gene; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; genetic association; genetic linkage; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; genotype; HDAC9 gene; human; intracranial aneurysm; major clinical study; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; nuclear magnetic resonance; polymerase chain reaction; RBBP8 gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; SOX17 gene; Asian continental ancestry group; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; intracranial aneurysm; male; middle aged; single nucleotide polymorphism","","Yonsei University College of Medicine","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069208948"

Methods: Our retrospective review included central pathology confirmed stage I or II UCCC treated and/or followed between 2000 and 2016. Cases with pure or mixed histology with >50% UCCC were included. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regressions. Results: 112 women were identified. Median age was 65.5 years (range 34–94). Most patients had mixed UCCC (61%), while 39% had pure UCCC. The majority of patients had stage IA UCCC (66%) versus stage IB (15%) or stage II (18%) disease. Adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy + radiation (26%), brachytherapy (27%), whole pelvic radiation (15%), chemotherapy alone (8%), and observation (24%). Thirty-eight (34%) women had recurrent disease. Median RFS was 4.32 years (95% CI 2.77–5.78). On multivariate analysis, age ≥70 (HR 2.48, 95% 1.28–4.81) and positive LVSI (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.15–4.18) were associated with shorter RFS. Median OS was 9.8 years (95% CI 7.46–15.93). On multivariate analyses, age ≥70 (HR 3.57, 95% CI 1.64–7.74) and positive LVSI (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.12–5.37) were associated with shorter OS. In this retrospective descriptive uncontrolled patient series, adjuvant treatment type did not impact RFS or OS. Conclusions: OS approaches 10 years for early stage UCCC patients. Women ≥70 years have worse PFS and OS regardless of treatment modality, encouraging consideration of quality of life implications when electing for adjuvant therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chemotherapy; Clear cell carcinoma; Endometrial cancer; Radiation","Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brachytherapy; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Neoplasms; Watchful Waiting; antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; brachytherapy; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; clear cell carcinoma; clinical feature; early cancer; female; follow up; histopathology; human; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; overall survival; priority journal; quality of life; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; uterine clear cell carcinoma; uterus carcinoma; very elderly; adenocarcinoma; adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adjuvant chemotherapy; adjuvant radiotherapy; age; Kaplan Meier method; longitudinal study; middle aged; mortality; pathology; proportional hazards model; uterus cancer; watchful waiting","","Academic Press Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067305288"

Whether impulsive-aggression (IA) moderated associations between cognitive-affective correlates of suicidal behavior and suicidality was also tested. Survey data on current SI, SA history, mindfulness, emotion reactivity, depressive symptom severity, and IA were collected from 780 emerging adults. Results from multinomial logistic regression analysis showed greater depressive symptom severity among emerging adults with current SI, regardless of SA history. Those with a history of SA reported greater depressive symptom severity and less mindfulness than controls. IA did not moderate relationships of SI and/or SA and mindfulness, emotion reactivity, or depressive symptom severity. Mindfulness is a marker of SA, and depressive symptom severity is associated with current SI and SA history in emerging adults. IA does not moderate these associations. To the extent that a history of SA is indicative of elevated trait-like suicide risk and SI indicates state suicidality, our findings suggest that mindfulness protects against longer-term vulnerability to suicide while depressive symptom severity is associated with suicide state-trait risk. © 2018, © 2018 International Academy for Suicide Research.","mindfulness; suicide attempt; suicide ideation","Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; Depression; Emotional Regulation; Female; Humans; Male; Mindfulness; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult; adolescent; case control study; depression; female; human; male; mindfulness; psychology; student; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; young adult","","Routledge","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059076354"

Etiology-associated dysregulation of immune-associated (IA) genes may be central to the development of this differential clinical response. We identified immune-associated genes potentially dysregulated by alcohol or viral hepatitis B in HCC and validated alcohol-induced dysregulations in vitro while using large-scale RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thirty-four clinically relevant dysregulated IA genes were identified. We profiled the correlation of all genomic alterations in HCC patients to IA gene expression while using the information theory-based algorithm REVEALER to investigate the molecular mechanism for their dysregulation and explore the possibility of genome-based patient stratification. We also studied gene expression regulators and identified multiple microRNAs that were implicated in HCC pathogenesis that can potentially regulate these IA genes’ expression. Our study identified potential key pathways, including the IL-7 signaling pathway and TNFRSF4 (OX40)-NF-κB pathway, to target in immunotherapy treatments and presents microRNAs as promising therapeutic targets for dysregulated IA genes because of their extensive regulatory roles in the cancer immune landscape. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, 1452 fecal specimens were collected from farmed crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Hainan, China during the period April 2016 to January 2018. These specimens were analyzed for Cryptosporidium species and subtypes by using PCR and sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA and 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) genes, respectively. Results: Altogether, Cryptosporidium was detected using 18S rRNA-based PCR in 132 (9.1%) sampled animals, with significantly higher prevalence in females (12.5% or 75/599 versus 6.1% or 43/706), younger animals (10.7% or 118/1102 in monkeys 1-3-years-old versus 4.0% or 14/350 in those over 3-years-old) and animals with diarrhea (12.6% or 46/365 versus 7.9% or 86/1087). Four Cryptosporidium species were identified, namely C. hominis, C. parvum, Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium ubiquitum in 86, 30, 15 and 1 animal, respectively. The identified C. parvum, C. hominis and C. ubiquitum were further subtyped by using gp60 PCR. Among them, C. parvum belonged to subtypes in two known subtype families, namely IIoA14G1 (in 18 animals) and IIdA19G1 (in 2 animals). In contrast, C. hominis mostly belonged to two new subtype families Im and In, which are genetically related to Ia and Id, respectively. The C. hominis subtypes identified included ImA18 (in 38 animals), InA14 (in six animals), InA26 (in six animals), InA17 (in one animal) and IiA17 (in three animals). The C. ubiquitum isolates belonged to subtype family XIId. By subtype, ImA18 and IIoA14G1 were detected in animals with diarrhea whereas the remaining ones were mostly found in asymptomatic animals. Compared with C. parvum and C. muris, higher oocyst shedding intensity was observed in animals infected with C. hominis, especially those infected with the Im subtype family. Conclusions: Data from the study suggest that crab-eating macaques are infected with diverse C. parvum and C. hominis subtypes. The C. parvum IIo subtype family previously seen in rodents in China has apparently expanded its host range. © 2019 The Author(s).","Crab-eating macaques; Cryptosporidium; Cryptosporidium hominis; Cryptosporidium parvum; Subtypes","Age Factors; Animals; China; Cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; Cryptosporidium parvum; DNA, Protozoan; Feces; Female; Genotype; Host Specificity; Macaca fascicularis; Monkey Diseases; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; glycoprotein; glycoprotein gp 60; RNA 18S; unclassified drug; protozoal DNA; age; Article; controlled study; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; Cryptosporidium hominis; Cryptosporidium muris; Cryptosporidium parvum; Cryptosporidium ubiquitum; diarrhea; female; host range; Macaca fascicularis; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oocyst; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; sequence analysis; sex difference; species identification; animal; China; classification; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium parvum; DNA sequence; feces; genetics; genotype; isolation and purification; Macaca fascicularis; monkey disease; parasitology","","BioMed Central Ltd.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069154772"

Methods: From the major surgical complications of cervical cancer in China (MSCCCC) database, we obtained the demographic, clinical, treatment hospital and complication data of patients with cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy from 2004 to 2015 at 37 hospitals. The patients were assigned to the laparoscopic and abdominal surgery groups. The differences in the complication rates were analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: We identified a total of 18447 patients; 5491 (29.8%) underwent laparoscopic surgery and 12956 (70.2%) underwent abdominal surgery. The proportion of laparoscopic surgery rose from 0.35% in 2004 to 49.31% in 2015.

A more detailed analysis showed that laparoscopic surgery was associated with increased rates of intraoperative ureteral injury (OR = 3.83, 95% CI = 2.11–6.95), bowel injury (OR = 14.83, 95% CI = 1.32–167.25), vascular injury (OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.18–9.62), postoperative vesicovaginal fistula (OR = 4.16, 95% CI = 2.08–8.32), ureterovaginal fistula (OR = 4.16, 95% CI = 2.08–8.32), rectovaginal fistula (OR = 8.04, 95% CI = 1.63–39.53), and chylous leakage (OR = 10.65, 95% CI = 1.18–95.97), while abdominal surgery was more likely to cause bowel obstruction (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35–0.87). The two groups had similar rates of bladder injury, obturator nerve injury, pelvic hematoma, rectovaginal fistula and venous thromboembolism (P > 0.05).

Between January 2009 and June 2013, a total of 367 patients were admitted to the Orthopedics Department of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Patient data were retrospectively analyzed and included 160 males and 207 females. The ages of the patients were between 60 and 97 years and the average age was 72 +/- 3.9 years. According to the Evans-Jensen classification scheme, the fracture types were type IA (n = 18), type IB (n =3 1), type II (n=154), and type III (n = 164). A comparison between the two surgical methods (PFNA and HA) included the duration of surgery, intra-operative blood loss, post-operative weight-bearing time, implant complications, and the Harris hip score. The data were analyzed after 14-50 months (average 24 months) of follow-up. The gender and age of the patients did not differ significantly between the two methods of treatment; however, the duration of surgery between the PFNA hemi-arthroplasty groups did differ (hemi-arthroplasty required less time), the intra-operative blood loss in the PFNA group was significantly less than the hemi-arthroplasty group, and the post-operative weight-bearing time was significantly shorter in the hemi-arthroplasty group than the PFNA group. A retrospective study was conducted in 367 patients during the 42-month study period (January 2009-June 2013) to observe the efficacy of PFNA and hemi-arthroplasty. Complete data were available for analysis. There are significant advantages and disadvantages with respect to the two surgical treatment modalities. For elderly patients with unstable fractures, severe osteoporosis, and pre-operative mobility, hemi-arthroplasty is preferred because hemi-arthroplasty has fewer disadvantages compared to PFNA, which is not suitable for full weight bearing and bone union. PFNA for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures has been increasingly accepted and widely used; however the use of arthroplasty remains controversial (3). Conservative treatment for intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients has become a main trend and often takes longer, gives rise to more complications, and has mortality rates higher than surgical treatment. © 2019, Acta Orthopaedica Belgica.","Arthroplasty; Elderly; Hip; Intertrochanteric fractures; PFNA; Replacement","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Loss, Surgical; Bone Nails; Female; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Hemiarthroplasty; Hip Fractures; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; aged; bone nail; female; hemiarthroplasty; hip fracture; human; intramedullary nailing; male; middle aged; operative blood loss; procedures; retrospective study; treatment outcome; very elderly","","ARSMB-KVBMG","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087055354"

We evaluated the feasibility and surgical advantages of double-arm lung specimen extraction method by comparing double-arm vs. single-arm specimen extraction times. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data for 268 patients undergoing partial lung resection via single-port thoracoscopy and specimen extraction using a specimen extractor in the Union Medical College Hospital of Fujian Medical University from November 2017 to June 2018. We divided patients into groups based on the specimen location as an upper-lobe group (group I), lower-lobe group (group II), and lung-segment group (group III). We then performed a subgroup analysis based on the degree of collapse of the lung lobe specimens during extraction as follows: good in group IA and IIA, and poor in group IB and IIB. Results: The double-arm method required statistically significantly less time than the single-arm method: (69.6±31.9 vs. 89.9±47.8 s, respectively, P=0.037). We found no significant difference in lung specimen extraction time for double-arm vs. single-arm extraction in group I, II, or III (P=0.093, P=0.153, P=0.174, respectively). We also found no significant difference in lung specimen extraction time between the two methods in group IA and group IIA (P=0.165, P=0.649, respectively). However, in groups IB and IIB, extraction time with the double-arm method was significantly shorter compared with the single-arm method (64.4±12.3 vs. 89.1±12.1 s, P=0.034 and 113.8±27.1 vs. 160.0±31.8 s, P=0.042, respectively). Conclusions: In single-port thoracoscopic partial lung resection, double-arm specimen extraction method is more convenient and can shorten sample extraction time, especially for upper- and lower-lung lobes with poor degree of collapse. Double-arm specimen extraction method is feasible and effective after single-port thoracoscopic partial lung resection. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

We sought to develop a risk algorithm to predict progression in children with high-risk human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes followed in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. Methods: Logistic regression and 4-fold cross-validation examined 38 candidate predictors of risk from clinical, immunologic, metabolic, and genetic data. TEDDY subjects with at least one persistent, confirmed autoantibody at age 3 were analyzed with progression to T1D by age 6 serving as the primary endpoint. The logistic regression prediction model was compared to two non-statistical predictors, multiple autoantibody status, and presence of insulinoma-associated-2 autoantibodies (IA-2A). Results: A total of 363 subjects had at least one autoantibody at age 3. Twenty-one percent of subjects developed T1D by age 6. Logistic regression modeling identified 5 significant predictors - IA-2A status, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index Z-score, single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12708716_G, and a combination marker of autoantibody number plus fasting insulin level. The logistic model yielded a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80, higher than the two other predictors; however, the differences in AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were small across models. Conclusions: This study highlights the application of precision medicine techniques to predict progression to diabetes over a 3-year window in TEDDY subjects. This multifaceted model provides preliminary improvement in prediction over simpler prediction tools. Additional tools are needed to maximize the predictive value of these approaches. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Using a between-subjects experimental design, thirty groups of two individuals each completed a card sorting activity using conventional in-person, video screen-sharing method or immersive virtual reality methods. The dependent measures included total time, percentage match with master card set, usability, presence and perceived workload. Overall usability was found to be significantly higher for the immersive virtual reality condition when compared to conventional in-person card sorting. In addition, the new immersive virtual reality technology performed as well as the other two conditions for other dependent variables. Qualitative data from the participants also indicated a positive reaction to the use of immersive virtual reality for this task.

Patients with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. From 2010 to 2017, 46 patients were treated using the modified Berlin–Frankfurt–Münster (BFM)-ALL-95 regimen. Hematologic and molecular complete remission (CR) rates of 91.3% and 76.1% were achieved. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for all patients in the cohort were 58.0% (95% confidence interval, 42.1–73.9%) and 66.7% (95% CI, 51.4–82.0%), respectively. No patient presented with central nervous system involvement after CR in this study. This condition could be related to four doses of high-dose methotrexate (MTX) every 3 months during the maintenance phase. Multivariate analysis revealed that minimal residual disease positive and time interval between induction IA and Protocol M of more than 70 days were independent adverse factors for EFS and OS. One or more instances of grade 4 myelosuppression occurred during induction therapy. Nonhematological side effects were mild. No toxicity-related deaths were observed in the entire cohort. The data indicated that the modified regimen is well tolerated and can produce the promising outcomes in Chinese adults with standard-risk ALL. © 2019, Japanese Society of Hematology.","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Adults; Modified BFM-95 regimen; Standard-risk","antineoplastic agent; asparaginase macrogol; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; dexamethasone; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; pirarubicin; prednisone; tioguanine; vincristine; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; bone marrow suppression; cancer chemotherapy; cancer survival; clinical article; cohort analysis; drug megadose; event free survival; female; flow cytometry; hair loss; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypoalbuminemia; hypofibrinogenemia; induction chemotherapy; infection; leukemia remission; male; minimal residual disease; mouth ulcer; nausea and vomiting; outcome assessment; overall survival; pancreatitis; retrospective study; side effect","","Springer Tokyo","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069432424"

Patients and Methods: Data on 702 consecutive patients who underwent either AR (n = 319) or NAR (n = 383) for ICC were reviewed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) following AR versus NAR was compared using propensity score matching (PSM). Subgroups of patients who benefited from AR versus NAR were examined after being stratified by the 8th TNM staging of ICC. Results: AR and NAR had similar complication rates (26.6% vs. 25.1%, p = 0.634). AR was associated with better 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS and OS rates compared with NAR after PSM (58.1%, 35.7% and 28.1% vs. 44.1%, 23.9% and 18.0%; 72.9%, 45.7% and 36.0% vs. 62.0%, 30.8% and 25.3%; both p = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, NAR was associated with worse DFS and OS than AR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.461 and 1.488; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.184–1.804 and 1.189–1.863, respectively]. Stratified analysis demonstrated similar outcomes following AR versus NAR for ICC at stages IA, II with vascular invasion, and III with visceral peritoneum perforation, local extrahepatic invasion and nodal metastasis, while NAR was associated with worse DFS and OS versus AR for stages IB (HR 1.897 and 2.321; 95% CI 1.179–3.052 and 1.376–3.914, respectively) or II ICC without vascular invasion (2.071 and 2.077; 95% CI 1.239–3.462 and 1.205–3.579, respectively).
