Methods Respondents were came from Wannan Medical College, China. The Young’s Internet Addiction Test, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Harm Questionnaire were used in this cross-sectional survey. A total of 3,738 medical students were investigated, 1,552 (41.52%) males, 2,186 (58.48%) females. T-test, chi-square test and MANOVA were used for data analysis. Results Of the 3,738 medical students, 1,054 (28.2%) reported having IA, 1,126 (30.1%) reported having poor sleep quality, 563 (15.1%) having self-harm behaviors. IA tends to be more female, upper grade students. The sleep quality of IA was worse than that of non-IA (χ2=54.882, p<0.001), and the possibility of self-injury was higher than non-IA (χ2=107.990, p<0.001). Conclusion This survey shows that the IA detection rate of medical students was 28.2%. Females, higher grade students had a higher IA detection rate. The low sleep quality and self-injury behavior of medical students are associated with IA. © 2020 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.","Internet addition; Medical students; Self-harm; Sleep quality","adult; Article; automutilation; Chinese; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; internet addiction; major clinical study; male; medical student; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; questionnaire; sleep disorder; sleep latency; sleep quality; sleep time","","Korean Neuropsychiatric Association","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082796505"

During a period of 1 year (from Jan 2016 to Dec 2016), consecutive patients with suspected PTB were included in a referral TB hospital. Data, including demographic information and underlying diseases, were collected from medical records. PTB were all confirmed by mycobacterial culture (Lowenstein-Jensen medium). IA were diagnosed as proven or probable according to the criteria of the 2008 EORTC/MSG definitions. A descriptive analysis was performed to estimate the corresponding prevalence. During the study year, 1507 patients have a positive mycobacterial culture, with a mean age of 45.6 (SD 19.9) years old and a female: male ratio of 1:4. Among the 82 patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases, 2 patients (2.44%, 95% CI: 0.67%-8.46%) were diagnosed as IA (1 proven and 1 probable); 2 probable IA patients (0.15%, 95% CI: 0.04%-0.55%) were diagnosed in PTB patients (n=1315), and all were retreatment cases. In addition, all the 4 IA patients (100%) exhibited cavities in both lobes on radiograph. In China, the prevalence of IA is low in active PTB patients. However, when high risk factors for IA are encountered in PTB patients, further investigations are required and empirically treatment for IA might be warranted. © The Authors 2020.","Aspergillus; Cavity; Prevalence; Tuberculosis","","","Cambridge University Press","English","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097255985"

We aimed to explore the genetic overlap and associations between inflammation (IL6 signaling and CRP) and intracranial aneurysm (IA) risk. Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were used to assess the causal effects of soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R) (n = 21,758) and CRP (n = 204,402) levels on IA (7,495 cases and 71,934 controls) risk using genome-wide association study summary data of European individuals. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate the genetic correlations of CRP (n = 400,094) with IA. Results: MR analyses showed that circulating sIL6R and CRP levels were not associated with the risk of IA. The odds ratios based on the inverse variance-weighted method were 0.986 (0.950–1.023, p = 0.45) and 0.957 (0.846–1.084, p = 0.49) for sIL6R and CRP, respectively. MR analyses using data of ruptured and unruptured IA each showed no association. Linkage disequilibrium score regression showed that the genetic correlation between CRP and IA was 0.16 (SE = 0.04, p = 0.0003). The genetic correlation diminished after conditioning IA on blood pressure (0.07 ± 0.05, p = 0.16), smoking (0.02 ± 0.05, p = 0.65), or blood pressure plus smoking (−0.03 ± 0.05, p = 0.53). Conclusion: Using associated genetic variants as instrument variables, two-sample MR analyses showed no evidence that circulating sIL6R and CRP levels were associated with IA risk. Although a positive genetic correlation was found between CRP levels and IA risk, it was mainly driven by the shared genetic background of blood pressure and smoking with both CRP and IA. © Copyright © 2021 Niu, Wang and Xu.","C-reactive protein; inflammation; interleukin-6; intracranial aneurysm; Mendelian randomization","C reactive protein; interleukin 6 receptor; adult; Article; blood pressure; cohort analysis; controlled study; European; female; gene expression; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic correlation; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; human; IL 6 signaling; inflammation; major clinical study; male; Mendelian randomization analysis; meta analysis; protein expression; randomized controlled trial; single nucleotide polymorphism; subarachnoid hemorrhage; unruptured intracranial aneurysm","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108608803"

We constructed a genetic risk score to (1) predict ASAH incidence and IA presence (combined set of unruptured IA and ASAH) and (2) assess its association with patient characteristics. Methods: A genetic risk score incorporating genetic association data for IA and 17 traits related to IA (so-called metaGRS) was created using 1161 IA cases and 407 392 controls from the UK Biobank population study. The metaGRS was validated in combination with risk factors blood pressure, sex, and smoking in 828 IA cases and 68 568 controls from the Nordic HUNT population study. Furthermore, we assessed association between the metaGRS and patient characteristics in a cohort of 5560 IA patients. Results: Per SD increase of metaGRS, the hazard ratio for ASAH incidence was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.20-1.51) and the odds ratio for IA presence 1.09 (95% CI, 1.01-1.18). Upon including the metaGRS on top of clinical risk factors, the concordance index to predict ASAH hazard increased from 0.63 (95% CI, 0.59-0.67) to 0.65 (95% CI, 0.62-0.69), while prediction of IA presence did not improve. The metaGRS was statistically significantly associated with age at ASAH (β=-4.82×10-3per year [95% CI, -6.49×10-3to -3.14×10-3]; P=1.82×10-8), and location of IA at the internal carotid artery (odds ratio=0.92 [95% CI, 0.86-0.98]; P=0.0041). Conclusions: The metaGRS was predictive of ASAH incidence, although with limited added value over clinical risk factors. The metaGRS was not predictive of IA presence. Therefore, we do not recommend using this metaGRS in daily clinical care. Genetic risk does partly explain the clinical heterogeneity of IA warranting prioritization of clinical heterogeneity in future genetic prediction studies of IA and ASAH. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk for invasive aspergillosis (IA), a disease with poor outcomes and substantial economic burden. We aimed to determine risk factors for posttransplant IA by using a national database and to assess the association of IA with mortality and allograft failure. Methods. Using the United States Renal Data System database, we performed a retrospective case-control study of patients who underwent kidney transplant from 1998 through 2017. To evaluate risk factors for IA, we performed conditional logistic regression analysis by comparing characteristics between IA-infected patients and their matched uninfected controls. We performed Cox regression analysis to evaluate the effects of IA on mortality and death-censored allograft failure. Results. We matched 359 patients with IA to 1436 uninfected controls (1:4). IA was diagnosed at a median of 22.5 months (interquartile range, 5.4–85.2 months) after kidney transplant. Risk factors for IA were Black/African American race, duration of pretransplant hemodialysis, higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score, weight loss, chronic pulmonary disease, need for early posttransplant hemodialysis, and a history of cytomegalovirus infection. Receiving an allograft from a living donor was protective against IA. IA was a strong independent predictor of 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 5.02 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.58–7.04], P < .001). Additionally, IA was associated with 1-year allograft failure (aHR, 3.37 [95% CI, 1.96–5.77], P < .001). Conclusions. Our findings emphasize the importance of timely transplant to mitigate the risk of posttransplant IA. An individualized approach to disease prevention is essential to decrease mortality and allograft failure. © The Author(s) 2022.

Nearly half of studies supporting IA guideline recommendations were randomized controlled trials (45%). Overall, about one third of studies supporting IA recommendations were publicly funded (34.9%) with slightly more funded through industry sources (43.5%). Funding sources varied based on the type of intervention being studied with randomized controlled trials of device, diagnostic, and pharmacological interventions reflecting predominantly industry-funded studies. Over time, studies supporting IA cardiology guideline are funded by industry about twice as often as public sources.

These symptoms are also associated with lower quality of life (QOL) and increased suicidality. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of IA symptoms in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and their association with QOL. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in three general and four psychiatric hospitals in Anhui Province, China, from January to July 2021. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. The Internet Addiction Test (IAT), Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Symptom Scale (CES-D), and World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF) were utilized to examine IA, depressive symptoms, and QOL, respectively. Results: In a multicenter sample of 278 adolescents with MDD, the prevalence of IA symptoms in adolescents with MDD was 46.8% (95% CI: 40.9–52.7%). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with more severe depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03–1.08), those living in a rural area (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.15–3.27), and those with poor academic performance (OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.42–5.95) were more likely to have IA symptoms. After controlling for confounding factors, patients with IA symptoms had significantly poorer QOL in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains than those without IA symptoms. Conclusion: IA symptoms are common in adolescents with MDD and appear to be associated with clinical symptoms. We could not infer a causal relationship between IA and depression because this was a cross-sectional study. Considering the positive association between IA symptoms and lower QOL, screening for IA symptoms should be conducted, and effective measures should be implemented for adolescents with MDD.

Method: 7515 cases of IA rupture from several municipal medical institutions in Fujian Province as well as local meteorological data during the same period were collected from 2013 to 2017. Poisson regression and Spearman correlation analysis were applied to explore the distribution characteristics of IA rupture and how it is associated with meteorological parameters. Poisson generalized additive model was established to further analyze the exposure-response relationships between meteorological factors and IA rupture, and its hysteresis effects. Result: The IA rupture exhibited a negative correlation with temperature (rs = −0.323, 95% CI: −0.539 ~ −0.068) and a positive correlation with atmospheric pressure (rs = 0.397, 95% CI: 0.152–0.597) or pressure difference (rs = 0.296, 95% CI: 0.038–0.517), 21.05 ℃ and 1000.14 hPa were the risk thresholds for the onset ascribed to variation in temperature and atmospheric pressure, respectively. Temperature and atmospheric pressure also exerted hysteresis effects on IA rupture. Cold will increase the rupture risk in the subsequent 1–3 days, and high pressure will raise the morbidity in the next 1–2 days. Besides, drastic variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure were also associated with the higher risk of IA rupture in the next 2 days and 1 day, respectively. Conclusion: Temperature and atmospheric pressure have a negative and positive correlation with IA rupture in Fujian, China, respectively. Variation in temperature and atmospheric pressure exert different degrees of hysteresis effects on IA rupture. © 2021 The Authors","Atmospheric pressure; Hysteresis effects; Meteorology; Temperature","Atmospheric Pressure; China; Humans; Incidence; Intracranial Aneurysm; Seasons; Temperature; China; Fujian; air temperature; atmospheric pressure; brain; climate variation; hysteresis; meteorology; nervous system disorder; atmospheric pressure; China; clinical trial; human; incidence; intracranial aneurysm; multicenter study; season; temperature","","Academic Press","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112483820"

However, how such variants affect gene expression within IA is poorly understood. We used publicly-available ChIP-Seq data to study chromatin landscapes surrounding risk loci to determine whether IA-associated SNPs affect functional elements that regulate gene expression in cell types comprising IA tissue. Methods: We mapped 16 significant IA-associated SNPs to linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks within human genome. Using ChIP-Seq data, we examined these regions for presence of H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K9ac histone marks (typically associated with latent/active enhancers). This analysis was conducted in several cell types that are present in IA tissue (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, B cells, NK cells). In cell types with significant histone enrichment, we used HiC data to investigate topologically associated domains (TADs) encompassing the LD blocks to identify genes that may be affected by IA-associated variants. Bioinformatics were performed to determine the biological significance of these genes. Genes within HiC-defined TADs were also compared to differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq/microarray studies of IA tissues. Results: We found that endothelial cells and fibroblasts, rather than smooth muscle or immune cells, have significant enrichment for enhancer marks on IA risk haplotypes (p < 0.05). Bioinformatics demonstrated that genes within TADs subsuming these regions are associated with structural extracellular matrix components and enzymatic activity. The majority of histone marked TADs (83% fibroblasts [IMR90], 77% HUVEC) encompassed at least one differentially expressed gene from IA tissue studies. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that genetic variants associated with IA risk act on endothelial cells and fibroblasts. There is strong circumstantial evidence that this may be mediated through altered enhancer function, as genes in TADs encompassing enhancer marks have also been shown to be differentially expressed in IA tissue. These genes are largely related to organization and regulation of the extracellular matrix. This study builds upon our previous (Poppenberg et al., BMC Med Genomics, 2019) by including a more diverse set of data from additional cell types and by identifying potential affected genes (i.e. those in TADs). © 2021, The Author(s).","Epigenetics; Genetic risk; Histone mark; Intracranial aneurysm; Topologically associated domain","Genome-Wide Association Study; histone; Article; B lymphocyte; bioinformatics; brain dysfunction; cell differentiation; chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing; chromosome; controlled study; endothelium cell; enhancer region; epigenetics; fibroblast; gene expression; gene linkage disequilibrium; haplotype; human; human cell; human genome; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; intracranial aneurysm; lymphocyte; macrophage; monocyte; natural killer cell; neutrophil; RNA sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; smooth muscle; smooth muscle cell; T lymphocyte; genome-wide association study","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108076943"

Recent evidence supports the replacement of IA with well-tolerated oral bedaquiline (BDQ) and a shortened 9-12 month regimen. DESIGN: Using a Markov model, we analyzed the 5- year budgetary impact and cost per successful treatment outcome of four regimens: 1) IA long-course, 2) oral long-course, 3) IA short-course, and 4) oral short-course. We used the South African MDR/RR-TB case register (2013-2015) to assess treatment outcomes for the thenstandard IA long-course. Data on the improvement in outcomes for BDQ-based regimens were based on the literature. Costs were estimated from the provider perspective using costs incurred to provide decentralized treatment for MDR-TB at a Johannesburg hospital. RESULT S : Based on our analysis, by 2023, the cost/ successful outcome for the four regimens was respectively 1) US$7374, 2) US$7860, 3) US$5149, and 4) US$4922. The annual total cost of each regimen was US$37 million, US$43 million, US$26 million, and US$28 million. CONCLUS ION: Despite the high cost of BDQ, a BDQbased shortened regimen for the treatment of MDR/RRTB will result in improved treatment outcomes and cost savings for South Africa. © 2020 The Union.","Bedaquiline; Cost; Cost-effectiveness; MDR-TB; TB","Antitubercular Agents; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Care Costs; Humans; South Africa; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; aminoglycoside; bedaquiline; rifampicin; tuberculostatic agent; adult; Article; budget; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; drug cost; drug tolerability; female; health care cost; hospital; human; injection; major clinical study; Markov chain; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; ototoxicity; patient care; priority journal; rifampicin resistance; South Africa; treatment duration; treatment failure; treatment outcome; cost benefit analysis","","International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083872346"

However, interference is one of the critical challenges in MIMO-OFDM systems that degrades the overall performance. In this study, a novel interference alignment (IA) design-based diagonal-block channel charter to mitigate the interference for MIMO-OFDM systems is proposed. The proposed IA scheme can be used in physical layer security, e.g. anti-location. Based on the diagonal-block charter of the channel matrix, the optimal degree of freedom, i.e. The maximum number of multiple data streams concurrently transmitted interference-free can be achieved by IA. Correspondingly, the authors present the closed-form IA design scheme for some special scenarios, and two iterative IA ones for general scenarios in detail. Furthermore, the performance analysis of IA systems with diagonal-block channel error is provided, where the imperfect channel state information case is considered. The simulation results show that the IA design based on the diagonal-block channel can improve the sum-rate performance effectively, by sufficiently exploiting the spatial and frequency resources. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","","Data streams; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Gain control; MIMO systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio broadcasting; Critical challenges; Frequency resources; Imperfect channel state information; Interference alignment; Interference-free; Multiple data streams; Performance analysis; Physical layer security; Channel state information","","Institution of Engineering and Technology","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086429785"

To date, little is known about the potential psychophysiological contributions to which influence the family functioning on young adult's internet addiction (IA) symptoms. The aim of this research was to examine the moderating role of resting RSA and its link between family functioning and IA symptoms. Method: One-hundred and nine participants (69 men) aged between 17 and 21 years old completed questionnaires on family functioning and IA symptoms. Data pertaining to RSA was collected during a resting period in the laboratory. Results: Resting RSA moderated the association between family functioning and IA symptoms. Specifically, poorer family functioning was related to higher levels of IA symptoms particularly for participants with low resting RSA. When the participants' resting RSA was high, family functioning showed no significant relation with IA symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that lower resting RSA may place young adults at greater risk for IA symptoms. This occurs when exposed to poorer family functioning. Furthermore, high resting RSA may serve as a protective factor that alleviates the detrimental influences of poor family functioning on IA symptoms. These findings highlight that contemporaneous consideration is needed for both contextual and physiological factors.

However, in a large sample, there is little research on the association between IA and insomnia in Chinese college students. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of insomnia and its related risk factors among Chinese college students with IA. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate 627 Chinese college students with IA. Each student completed a survey on demographic data, Internet addiction (Revised Chinese Internet Addiction Scale), depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale), anxiety (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), and suicidal behavior. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to adjust for confounding factors. Results: The prevalence of insomnia among students with IA was 54.86%. Compared with IA students without insomnia, IA students with insomnia were more likely to be younger, smoking, drinking, have anxiety, depression, suicidal ideations, suicide plans, and suicide attempts (all p < 0.05). Moreover, drinking [OR, 1.664; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.139–2.431; p = 0.008], anxiety (OR, 2.321; 95% CI, 1.116–4.826; p = 0.024), and suicidal ideation (OR, 1.942; 95% CI:1.295–2.911; p = 0.001) were independently associated with insomnia in IA students. Conclusions: Insomnia is very common in Chinese IA students. Drinking, anxiety, and suicidal ideation are independently correlated with insomnia.

Methods: A total of 1946 patients with solitary and histopathologically confirmed GGNs with maximum diameter less than 3 cm were retrospectively enrolled. The training dataset containing 1704 GGNs was augmented by resampling, scaling, random cropping, and so forth, to generate new training data. A multimodal data fusion model based on residual learning architecture and two multilayer perceptron with attention mechanism combining CT images with patient general data and serum tumor markers was built. The distance-based confidence scores (DCS) were calculated and compared among multimodal data models with different combinations. An observer study was conducted and the prediction performance of the fusion algorithms was compared with that of the two radiologists by an independent testing dataset with 242 GGNs. Results: Among the whole GGNs, 606 GGNs are confirmed as invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) and 1340 are non-IA. The proposed novel multimodal data fusion model combining CT images, patient general data, and serum tumor markers achieved the highest accuracy (88.5%), area under a ROC curve (0.957), F1 (81.5%), F1weighted (81.9%), and Matthews correlation coefficient (73.2%) for classifying between IA and non-IA GGNs, which was even better than the senior radiologist's performance (accuracy, 86.1%). In addition, the DCSs for multimodal data suggested that CT image had a stronger influence (0.9540) quantitatively than general data (0.6726) or tumor marker (0.6971). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the feasibility of integrating different types of data including CT images and clinical variables, and the multimodal data fusion model yielded higher performance for distinguishing IA from non-IA GGNs. © 2022 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","computed tomography; computer-aided diagnosis; convolutional neural network; deep learning; ground-glass nodule","Adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Biomarkers, Tumor; Deep Learning; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Biological organs; Biomarkers; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Diseases; Forecasting; Glass; Image fusion; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Tumors; tumor marker; tumor marker; Computed tomography; Computed tomography images; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Fusion model; Ground glass nodules; Invasiveness; Multimodal data fusion; Serum tumor markers; Stage I; adult; Article; cancer model; cancer patient; cancer staging; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; convolutional neural network; correlation coefficient; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; feasibility study; female; ground glass opacity; histopathology; human; human tissue; image analysis; image processing; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multilayer perceptron; retrospective study; risk assessment; tumor invasion; adenocarcinoma; diagnostic imaging; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; pathology; procedures; tumor invasion; x-ray computed tomography; Deep learning","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135809414"

Participants had knee radiographs and bilateral knee CTs at baseline, and pain assessments every 8 months for 2 years. CT images were scored using the Boston University Calcium Knee Score. We longitudinally examined the relation of CT-detected IA mineralization to the risk of frequent knee pain (FKP), intermittent or constant knee pain worsening, and pain severity worsening using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results: We included 2,093 participants (mean age 61 years, 57% women, mean body mass index 28.8 kg/m2). Overall, 10.2% of knees had IA mineralization. The presence of any IA mineralization in the cartilage was associated with 2.0 times higher odds of having FKP (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38–2.78) and 1.86 times more frequent intermittent or constant pain (95% CI 1.20–2.78), with similar results seen for the presence of any IA mineralization in the meniscus or joint capsule. A higher burden of IA mineralization anywhere within the knee was associated with a higher odds of all pain outcomes (odds ratio ranged from 2.14 to 2.21). Conclusion: CT-detected IA mineralization was associated with risk of having more frequent, persistent, and worsening knee pain over 2 years. Targeting IA mineralization may have therapeutic potential for pain improvement in knee OA. © 2023 American College of Rheumatology.","","Calcinosis; Calcium; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Pain; calcium; adult; aged; Article; body mass; bone mineralization; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; female; human; joint capsule; knee meniscus; knee osteoarthritis; knee pain; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; national health organization; odds ratio; pain assessment; pain severity; prevalence; prospective study; calcinosis; clinical trial; complication; diagnostic imaging; knee; knee osteoarthritis; middle aged; multicenter study; pain","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174213559"

The safety and efficacy of anatomic and reverse TSA in this population has not been as well studied compared to OA. We analyzed the differences in outcomes between IA and OA patients undergoing TSA. Methods: Patients who underwent primary anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) from 2016-2020 were identified in the Premier Healthcare Database. Inflammatory arthritis (IA) patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes and compared to osteoarthritis controls. Patients were matched in a 1:8 fashion by age (±3 years), sex, race, and presence of pertinent comorbidities. Patient demographics, hospital factors, and patient comorbidities were compared. Multivariate regression was performed following matching to account for any residual confounding and 90-day complications were compared between the 2 cohorts. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were employed with significance set at P < .05. Results: Prior to matching, 5685 IA cases and 93,539 OA controls were identified. Patients with IA were more likely to be female, have prolonged length of stay and increased total costs (P < .0001). After matching and multivariate analysis, 4082 IA cases and 32,656 controls remained. IA patients were at increased risk of deep wound infection (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.38-7.16, P = .006), implant loosening (OR 4.11, 95% CI 1.17-14.40, P = .027), and mechanical complications (OR 6.34, 95% CI 1.05-38.20, P = .044), as well as a decreased risk of postoperative stiffness (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.83, P = .002). Medically, IA patients were at increased risk of PE (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.52-5.77, P = .001) and acute blood loss anemia (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.44, P < .0001). Discussion and conclusion: Inflammatory arthritis represents a distinctly morbid risk profile compared to osteoarthritis patients with multiple increased surgical and postoperative medical complications in patients undergoing aTSA and rTSA. Surgeons should consider these potential complications and employ a multidisciplinary approach in preoperative risk stratification of IA undergoing shoulder replacement. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees","anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty; complications; inflammatory arthritis; Level III; osteoarthritis; outcomes; Prognosis Study; Retrospective Cohort Comparison Using Large Database; reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; Shoulder arthroplasty","Arthroplasty, Replacement; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Osteoarthritis; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Shoulder Joint; Treatment Outcome; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; data base; female; health insurance; hospital patient; hospitalization cost; human; ICD-10; International Classification of Diseases; length of stay; major clinical study; male; osteoarthritis; prognosis; retrospective study; reverse shoulder arthroplasty; rheumatoid arthritis; shoulder replacement; total shoulder arthroplasty; complication; osteoarthritis; postoperative complication; replacement arthroplasty; shoulder joint; shoulder replacement; surgery; treatment outcome","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183043423"

However, the pathogenesis of IA has not been clarified. Objective: In this study, we explored the role of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) gene to explore a novel mechanism underlying IA. Methods: First, we verified the role of the candidate gene, TREM2 in a modified mouse model of IA. Second, we verified elevated expression of TREM2 using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE54083 and GSE75436) and developed protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using the top one hundred DEGs from GSE75436 dataset. Finally, we predicted a likely mechanism by which TREM2 is involved in the pathology of IA using single-gene Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Results: The expression of TREM2 and inflammatory factors was significantly increased in the modified mouse IA model, and showed a positive correlation. Elevated expression of TREM2 was also found in IA patients tissues from the GSE54083 and GSE75436 data sets. PPI network analyses suggested that the DEGs were involved in a variety of inflammatory processes. The GSEA results suggest that TREM2 may participate in IA progression by regulating macrophage function. Conclusion: TREM2 is highly expressed in both human and mouse IA tissues, and may participate in IA progression by regulating macrophage function and inflammatory factor expression. The molecular mechanism of TREM2 involvement in the IA process can be further studied using our modified mouse IA model.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","differentially expressed genes; GEO; intracranial aneurysms; macrophages; mouse model; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2","Animals; Brain; Computational Biology; Datasets as Topic; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Macrophages; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Protein Interaction Maps; Receptors, Immunologic; actin antibody; elastase; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; pentobarbital; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; toll like receptor; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; tumor necrosis factor; immunoglobulin receptor; membrane protein; TREM2 protein, human; Trem2 protein, mouse; adult; aneurysm rupture; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain tissue; controlled study; correlation analysis; cytokine production; data base; differential expression analysis; differential gene expression; extracellular matrix; gene expression; gene set enrichment analysis; granulocyte; immune response; inflammation; intracranial aneurysm; leukocyte migration; macrophage activation; macrophage function; male; mouse; mouse model; myeloid leukocyte; network analysis; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory mechanism; saccular aneurysm; Staphylococcus aureus infection; TLR signaling; animal; biology; brain; disease model; gene expression profiling; gene regulatory network; genetics; human; immunology; information processing; intracranial aneurysm; macrophage; metabolism; pathology; protein analysis; vascularization","","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118272192"

However, the exact causal relationship between gut microbiota and IA has not been confirmed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The instrumental variables (IVs) for gut microbiota were obtained from a meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the MiBioGen consortium (n = 13,266). The summary of GWAS data for IA was obtained from a large genome-wide meta-analysis involving 23 cohorts. Five Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were used to investigate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and IA (ruptured and unruptured), unruptured intracranial aneurysm only (uIA), and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) respectively, with inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the main MR method. All MR results were verified through sensitive analyses. RESULTS: Based on the results of the IVW analyses, it was found that five gut microbiota taxa were causally associated with IA (ruptured and unruptured), seven gut microbiota taxa were causally associated with uIA, and six gut microbiota taxa were causally associated with aSAH. Among these taxa, the genus Bilophila was the only one identified to have significant protective effects against IA (ruptured and unruptured), uIA, and aSAH. The sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy among the included IVs. CONCLUSIONS: MR analyses identified several gut microbiota taxa that have a causal relationship with IA. Future research should prioritize understanding the mechanisms underlying this causal relationship, as it is expected to contribute to the development of new methods for predicting and treating IA. © 2024 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

However, the reported results in previous studies are inconsistent, and randomized data are absent. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to study the causal effects of genetically determined blood pressure (BP) and genetic proxies for antihypertensive drug classes on the risk of IA and SAH. Materials and methods: Genetic instruments and outcome data were obtained from independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or published data, which were exclusively restricted to European ancestry. Causal relationships were identified using inverse-variance weighted MR analyses and a series of statistical sensitivity analyses. The FinnGen consortium was used for repeated analysis to verify results obtained from the above GWAS. Results: Two-sample MR analysis showed that genetically determined Systolic BP, Dystolic BP, and Pulse Pressure were related to a higher risk of IA and SAH. Based on identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence the effect of calcium channel blockers (CCB, 42 SNPs), beta-blockers (BB, 8 SNPs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI, 2 SNPs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB, 1 SNPs), and thiazides (5 SNPs), genetically determined effect of CCBs was associated with a higher risk of IA (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03–1.10], p = 5.02 × 10−5) and SAH (OR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.03–1.09], p = 1.84 × 10−3). No associations were found between other antihypertensive drugs and the risk of IA or SAH. The effect of CCBs on SAH was confirmed in FinnGenconsortium samples (OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00–1.08], p = 0.042). Discussion and conclusion: This MR analysis supports the role of elevated blood pressure in the occurrence of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, genetic proxies for calcium channel blockers were associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms. © European Stroke Organisation 2023.","antihypertensive drugs; blood pressure; intracranial aneurysm; Ischemic stroke; Mendelian randomization; subarachnoid hemorrhage","Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Calcium Channel Blockers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antihypertensive agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; thiazide diuretic agent; antihypertensive agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; Article; blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotyping; human; intracranial aneurysm; Mendelian randomization analysis; outcome assessment; pleiotropy; pulse pressure; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; subarachnoid hemorrhage; systolic blood pressure; blood pressure; genetics; Mendelian randomization analysis","","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173748711"

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Internalized AIDS-Related Stigma Scale (IA-RSS). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the six-item IA-RSS was conducted using data from four cross-sectional surveys implemented in Cambodia (n = 1207), the Dominican Republic (n = 891), Uganda (n = 391) and Tanzania (n = 529) between 2018 and 2019. METHODS: IA-RSS scale item distribution was described. Multivariate regression models measured correlations between the IA-RSS and depression, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and viral suppression. Confirmatory factor analysis assessed IA-RSS reliability and performance through analysis of standardized factor loadings and conditional probabilities of scale items. Analysis of qualitative interviews with PLHIV explored acceptability of IA-RSS item content. RESULTS: Mean IA-RSS scores (possible 0-6) ranged from 2.06 (Uganda) to 3.84 (Cambodia), and internal consistency was more than 0.70 in each country (Kuder-Richardson 20), ranging from 0.71 to 0.83. Higher IA-RSS scores were strongly correlated with depression in (P < 0.001 in all countries), and inversely associated with current ART use (Dominican Republic and Tanzania) and self-reported viral suppression (Uganda and Tanzania). Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit (all CFI ≥ 0.950), but also that the IA-RSS may summarize two domains related to HIV status disclosure (two items) and PLHIV feelings about themselves (four items). CONCLUSION: Strong performance across countries supports continued use of the IA-RSS. Further study is needed to explore potential item refinements and to better understand the relationship between internalized stigma and HIV treatment outcomes.","","Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Cambodia; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dominican Republic; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Social Discrimination; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tanzania; Uganda; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; Cambodia; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; Dominican Republic; female; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; social discrimination; social stigma; Tanzania; Uganda","","NLM (Medline)","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090321039"

Methods: Myometrial invasion is classified into no myometrial invasion, <50% and ≥50%, with only no myometrial invasion and <50% are included in stage IA patients. A retrospective study is designed by collecting data from women diagnosed as stage IA endometrial cancer from January 2010 to December 2019 in a tertiary hospital. A propensity score is conducted for 1:1 matching in the low-risk histologic patients. Progression free survival and disease-specific survival data are evaluated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank test in both the whole population and the matched-pair groups. A sub-group analysis is performed to figure out risk factors associated with the effect of surgical approach on PFS and disease-specific survival (DSS). Results: 534 (84.49%) low-risk histologic endometrial cancer women, with 389 (72.85%) operated by minimally invasive surgery and 145 (27.15%) by open approach, and 98 (15.51%) high-risk histology, with 71 (72.45%) by laparoscopy and 27 (27.55%) by open surgery, are included. Compared to open surgery, laparoscopy results in lower progression free survival in low-risk patients before and after matching (p = 0.039 and p = 0.033, respectively), but shows no difference in high-risk patients (p = 0.519). Myometrial invasion is associated with lower progression free survival in laparoscopy in low-risk histology (p = 0.027).

The emerging research via RPA, AI and soft computing offers sophisticated decision analysis methods, data-driven DM and scenario analysis with regard to the consideration of decision choices and provides benefits in numerous engineering applications. The emerging intelligent automation (IA) – the combination of RPA, AI and soft computing – can further transcend traditional DM to achieve unprecedented levels of operational efficiency, decision quality and system reliability. RPA allows an intelligent agent to eliminate operational errors and mimic manual routine decisions, including rule-based, well-structured and repetitive decisions involving enormous data, in a digital system, while AI has the cognitive capabilities to emulate the actions of human behaviour and process unstructured data via machine learning, natural language processing and image processing. Insights from IA drive new opportunities in providing automated DM processes, fault diagnosis, knowledge elicitation and solutions under complex decision environments with the presence of context-aware data, uncertainty and customer preferences.

However, it remains unclear how meditation impacts internal attention (IA) states due to lack of measurement tools that can objectively assess mental states during meditation practice itself, and produce time estimates of internal focus at individual or group levels. To address these measurement gaps, we tested the feasibility of applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to single-subject fMRI data to: (1) learn and recognize internal attentional states relevant for meditation during a directed IA task; and (2) decode or estimate the presence of those IA states during an independent meditation session. Within a mixed sample of experienced meditators and novice controls (N = 16), we first used MVPA to develop single-subject brain classifiers for five modes of attention during an IA task in which subjects were specifically instructed to engage in one of five states [i.e., meditation-related states: breath attention, mind wandering (MW), and self-referential processing, and control states: attention to feet and sounds]. Using standard cross-validation procedures, MVPA classifiers were trained in five of six IA blocks for each subject, and predictive accuracy was tested on the independent sixth block (iterated until all volumes were tested, N = 2,160). Across participants, all five IA states were significantly recognized well above chance (>41% vs. 20% chance). At the individual level, IA states were recognized in most participants (87.5%), suggesting that recognition of IA neural patterns may be generalizable for most participants, particularly experienced meditators. Next, for those who showed accurate IA neural patterns, the originally trained classifiers were applied to a separate meditation run (10-min) to make an inference about the percentage time engaged in each IA state (breath attention, MW, or self-referential processing). Preliminary group-level analyses demonstrated that during meditation practice, participants spent more time attending to breath compared to MW or self-referential processing. This paradigm established the feasibility of using MVPA classifiers to objectively assess mental states during meditation at the participant level, which holds promise for improved measurement of internal attention states cultivated by meditation. © Copyright © 2020 Weng, Lewis-Peacock, Hecht, Uncapher, Ziegler, Farb, Goldman, Skinner, Duncan, Chao and Gazzaley.","attention; interoception; meditation; mind wandering; multivoxel pattern analysis; self-referential processing","adult; article; attention; brain; breathing; classifier; controlled study; cross validation; feasibility study; female; foot; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human cell; human experiment; interoception; major clinical study; male; meditation; mental health; mind wandering; sound; validation process","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090861322"

Methods: The clinical and genotypic data of 49 patients with hepatic GSDs were collected retrospectively and analyzed. Results: After gene sequencing, 49 patients were diagnosed as GSDs, including GSD Ia (24 cases), GSD IIIa (11 cases), GSD IXa (8 cases), GSD VI (3 cases) and GSD Ib (3 cases). About 45 gene variants of G6PC, AGL, PHKA2, PYGL, and SLC37A4 were detected; among which, 22 variants were unreported previously. c.648G>T (p. Leu216Leu) of G6PC exon 5 is the most common variant for GSD Ia patients (20/24,83.33%）, splice variant c.1735+1G>T of AGL exon 13 is relatively common among GSD IIIa, while novel variant accounts for the majority of GSD IXa and GSD VI patients. As for clinical features, there was no significant difference in the onset age among group GSD Ia, GSD IIIa, and GSD IXa, but the age at diagnosis and average disease duration from diagnosis of GSD Ia were significantly higher than GSD IIIa and GSD IXa. Body weight of GSD patients was basically normal, but growth retardation was relatively common among them, especially for GSD Ia patients; and renomegaly was only found in GSD Ia. Besides, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, lactic acid, and uric acid in GSD Ia were significantly higher than those with GSD IIIa and IXa (p < 0.05); but ALT, AST, CK, and LDH of GSD III and GSD IXa were significantly higher when compared to GSD Ia (p < 0.05). Conclusions: All hepatic GSDs patients share similarity in clinical and biochemical spectrum, but delayed diagnosis and biochemical metabolic abnormalities were common in GSD Ia. For family with GSD proband, pedigree analysis and genetic testing is strongly recommended. © 2020 The Authors.

Previous studies have revealed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VCAN gene are associated with susceptibility to IAs in European or Japanese populations. However, the association between IA susceptibility and VCAN SNPs in the Eastern Chinese population remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations of the SNPs rs251124, rs2287926, and rs173686 with IA susceptibility in the Eastern Chinese population. Methods: A total of 162 patients with IA and 182 controls were enrolled in this study. The study was conducted between January 2017 and December 2020. SNP genotyping for rs251124, rs2287926, and rs173686 was performed using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) after DNA extraction. The SNP data were analysed with CFX Manager Software version 3.1 (Bio-Rad). Results: rs251124 and rs173686 were significantly associated with susceptibility to IA. The frequency of rs251124-TT in IA was higher than in controls (OR =1.26, 95% CI: 1.07–1.49; P<0.01), and its risk mainly came from the T allele. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that the T/T genotype and T allele of rs251124 were independent risk factors for IA (OR=1.726, 95% CI: 1.136–2.263; P=0.011). Moreover, the G/G genotype and G allele of rs173686 were associated with increased IA susceptibility (OR=2.52, 95% CI: 1.261–5.037; P=0.009). Conclusion: The SNPs rs251124 and rs173686 were strongly associated with genetic susceptibility to IA in the Eastern Chinese population; however, no such association was found in the SNP rs2287926 of VCAN. Our findings suggest that the VCAN gene is an IA susceptible gene that should be further studied as a screening marker for IAs. © 2021 Zhu et al.","Eastern Chinese population; Intracranial aneurysm; SNP; Susceptibility; VCAN gene","versican; adult; allele; Article; Chinese; controlled study; disease predisposition; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; human; human cell; intracranial aneurysm; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prevalence; prospective study; retrospective study; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; versican gene","","Dove Medical Press Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120794781"

The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to analyze the clinical characteristics and therapy of two patients with VDDR-IA from two separate Chinese families, and (2) investigate the CYP27B1 gene mutations in two large pedigrees. Methods: Medical history, clinical manifestations, physical examination, radiological findings and laboratory data were analyzed from two patients with VDDR-IA. Serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25-(OH)2D3] of the two patients and their respective families were measured by ELISA and blood samples from both families was obtained for CYP27B1 gene sequence. Results: Two patients had typical manifestations and radiological evidence of rickets. Laboratory data showed hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia, along with high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. However, serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 level were low in the patients but normal in their family members. Genetic sequence identified two patients were homozygous for a duplication mutation in exon 8 of CYP27B1 gene (c.1319_1325dupCCCACCC, p.Phe443Profs*24). After treating with calcitriol and calcium, there was biochemical improvement with normalization of serum calcium and phosphorus, and radiographic evidence of compensatory skeletal mineralization. One patient developed nephrocalcinosis during follow-up. Conclusions: This study identified a recurrent seven-nucleotide insertion of CYP27B1 in two large pedigrees, and compared the clinical characteristics and individual therapy of two affected patients. Additionally, our experience further supports the notion that nephrocalcinosis can occur even on standard doses of calcitriol and oral calcium, and normal level of serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH and 25-(OH)D3. © 2020 The Author(s).","CYP27B1; Genetic sequence analysis; Nephrocalcinosis; Treatment; Vitamin D-dependent rickets type IA","25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase; China; Familial Hypophosphatemic Rickets; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Vitamin D; alkaline phosphatase; calcifediol; calcitriol; calcium; parathyroid hormone; phosphate; calcidiol 1 monooxygenase; vitamin D; alkaline phosphatase blood level; anamnesis; Article; blood sampling; calcium blood level; case report; child; Chinese; clinical article; controlled study; CYP27B1 gene; drug dose increase; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exon; female; follow up; gene duplication; gene identification; gene insertion; gene mutation; gene sequence; human; hypocalcemia; hypophosphatemia; kidney calcification; laboratory test; mutator gene; parathyroid hormone blood level; pedigree analysis; phosphate blood level; physical examination; preschool child; rickets; vitamin D dependent rickets type IA; wrist radiography; China; familial hypophosphatemic rickets; genetics","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092413448"

In situ hybridization (ISH) assays that identify HER2 gene amplification function as a stand-alone test for determination of HER2 status and rely on the manual quantification of the number of HER2 genes and copies of chromosome 17 to determine HER2 amplification. Methods: To assist pathologists, we have developed the uPath HER2 Dual ISH Image Analysis for Breast (uPath HER2 DISH IA) algorithm, as an adjunctive aid in the determination of HER2 gene status in breast cancer specimens. The objective of this study was to compare uPath HER2 DISH image analysis vs manual read scoring of VENTANA HER2 DISH-stained breast carcinoma specimens with ground truth (GT) gene status as the reference. Three reader pathologists reviewed 220, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer cases by both manual and uPath HER2 DISH IA methods. Scoring results from manual read (MR) and computer-assisted scores (image analysis, IA) were compared against the GT gene status generated by consensus of a panel of pathologists. The differences in agreement rates of HER2 gene status between manual, computer-assisted, and GT gene status were determined. Results: The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) rates for image analysis (IA) vs GT were 97.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 95.0, 99.3) and 94.3% (95% CI: 90.8, 97.3) respectively. Comparison of agreement rates showed that the lower bounds of the 95% CIs for the difference of PPA and NPA for IA vs MR were –0.9% and –6.2%, respectively. Further, inter- and intra-reader agreement rates in the IA method were observed with point estimates of at least 96.7%.

This bibliometric analysis aimed to map the knowledge network of IA hemodynamic research. Methods: Studies on hemodynamics in IAs published from 1999 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). The contributions of countries, institutions, authors, and journals were identified using VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, and Microsoft Excel. Tendencies, frontier topics, and knowledge networks were analyzed and visualized using VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Results: We identified 2,319 publications on hemodynamics in IAs. The annual number of publications exhibited an overall increasing trend. Among these, the United States, Japan, and China were the three major contributing countries. Capital Medical University, State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo University, and George Mason University were the three most productive institutions.

However, due to the high mobility of trains, the traditional initial access (IA) scheme with high time consumption is difficult to guarantee the effectiveness of the beam alignment. In addition, the high path loss at the coverage edge of the millimeter wave remote radio unit (mmW-RRU) will also bring great challenges to the stability of IA performance. Fortunately, the train trajectory in HSR scenarios is periodic and regular. Moreover, the cell-free network helps to improve the system coverage performance. Based on these observations, this paper proposes an efficient IA scheme based on location and history information in cell-free networks, where the train can flexibly select a set of mmW-RRUs according to the received signal quality. We specifically analyze the collaborative IA process based on the exhaustive search and based on location and history information, derive expressions for IA success probability and delay, and perform the numerical analysis.

Understanding the role and socio-economic consequences of digitalization is crucial for the way technology is being deployed in each sector. One of the affected sectors is dentistry. This study highlights the current advances and challenges in integrating and merging artificial intelligence (AI), intelligence augmentation (IA), and machine learning (ML) in dentistry. We conduct a comparative analysis to give an overview of which technology is being currently deployed and what role IA and AI will play in dentistry, as AI plays an assistive role in advancing human capabilities. We find that challenges range from AI finding its way into routine medical practice to qualitative challenges of retrieving adequate data input. Other challenges lie in the yet unanswered questions of liability in how to reduce deployment costs of new technology. Given these challenges, we provide an outlook of how future technology can be deployed in daily-life dentistry and how robots and humans will interact, given the current technology developments. The aim of this paper is to discuss the future of dentistry and whether it is AI or IA conquering the modern dentistry era. © 2021 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); dentistry; intelligence augmentation (IA); smart dentistry","","","MDPI","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122078865"

This study sought to compare outcomes after ovarian surgery with IA in the pediatric population. Methods: Females (≤20 y old) undergoing ovarian surgeries (oophorectomy, detorsion and/or drainage) were identified from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2018). Those with appendicitis were excluded. A propensity score-matched analysis (PSMA) with 46 covariates (demographics, comorbidities, hospitalization factors, etc.) was performed between those receiving ovarian surgery with or without IA. Results: There were 13,202 females (median age 17 [IQR 14-20] y old) who underwent oophorectomy (90%), detorsion (26%), and/or ovarian drainage (13%). There were more episodes of torsion in the PSMA cohort receiving ovarian surgery alone (17% versus 10% IA; P = 0.016), while other indications (ovarian mass, cyst) were similar. Open (66% versus 34% laparoscopic) IAs were more frequent. Length of stay (LOS) was longer for those undergoing IA (3 [2-4] versus 2 [2-4] days ovarian surgery alone; P < 0.001). There was a higher rate of postoperative GI complications in the IA cohort. Subgroup analysis of those undergoing laparoscopic operations demonstrated no difference in LOS or postoperative complications between patients undergoing IA or not. Conclusions: These data indicate that IA in pediatric ovarian operations is associated with longer LOS and higher GI postoperative complications. However, laparoscopic IA was not associated with higher cost, complications, LOS, or readmissions. This suggests that IA performed during ovarian surgeries in select patients may be cost-effective and worthy of future study. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Incidental appendectomy; Oophorectomy; Ovarian detorsion; Ovarian torsion; Pediatric; Readmissions","Adolescent; Appendectomy; Appendicitis; Child; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; adolescent; adult; appendectomy; appendicitis; Article; child; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; female; home care; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; incidental appendectomy; incidental finding; infant; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; nursing home; ovariectomy; ovary cancer; ovary cyst; ovary torsion; postoperative complication; propensity score; appendectomy; appendicitis; complication; laparoscopy; length of stay; postoperative complication; retrospective study","","Academic Press Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166585873"

Methods: Genetic variants for the effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A1, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides and targets for lipid-modifying drugs were selected from the genome-wide discovery analyses of the UK Biobank. Summary-level data on IAs were obtained from the International Stroke Genetics Consortium. Univariate and multivariate MR analyses were performed. Results: Univariate MR analyses showed that the HDL-C was negatively correlated with IA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.816, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.715–0.932, p = 0.003) and ruptured IA (rIA; OR = 0.775, 95% CI = 0.663–0.906, p = 0.001). The multivariate MR–inverse variance weighted analysis showed that the HDL-C was negatively correlated with IA (OR = 0.655, 95% CI = 0.434–0.988, p = 0.043) and rIA (OR = 0.563, 95% CI = 0.347–0.913, p = 0.02), and the LDL-C was negatively correlated with IA (OR = 0.402, 95% CI = 0.191–0.848, p = 0.017) and rIA (OR = 0.376, 95% CI = 0.160–0.883, p = 0.025). Using genetic proxies of known lipid-modifying drugs, we found that the increased HDL-C with cholesterol ester transfer protein proxies was associated with a decreased risk of rIA (OR = 0.852, 95% CI = 0.747–0.973, p = 0.018), and the decreased LDL-C with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase proxies was associated with increased risk of IA (OR = 1.772, 95% CI = 1.080–2.908, p = 0.024) and rIA (OR = 1.856, 95% CI = 1.022–3.371, p = 0.042). Conclusions: Genetically determined HDL-C and LDL-C reduce the risk of IA and rIA.

Therefore, this article develops an interval-aware probabilistic slow feature analysis (IA-PSFA) method along with the corresponding monitoring strategy to address the above problems for industrial processes. The IA-PSFA method incorporates functions of sampling intervals to adjust the influences of previous samples on the current one when inferring state variables. Specifically, different functions are designed such that the changing temporal correlations between adjacent samples caused by irregular sampling intervals can be tracked effectively. Parameters of the IA-PSFA model are estimated through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with an interval-aware Kalman filter, which addresses the missing variable issue along with irregular sampling intervals. After that, three statistics are constructed based on the state variables, transition and emission errors, and the varying speed of the state variables, to establish comprehensive evaluations of processes. Finally, cases from the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method confronted with different degrees of data irregularity and missing values.  © 2013 IEEE.","Dynamic process monitoring; interval-aware probabilistic slow feature analysis (IA-PSFA); irregular sampling intervals; missing values; varying speed","Kalman filters; Maximum principle; Process control; State space methods; Correlation; Dynamic process monitoring; Feature analysis; Features extraction; Interval-aware probabilistic slow feature analyse; Irregular sampling; Irregular sampling interval; Missing values; Probabilistics; Sampling interval; State-space method; Varying speed; Process monitoring","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163488182"

We included case-control or cohort design studies comprising KT recipients with a diagnosis of IA, defined according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group criteria, and assessed risk factors for the development of IA. Random-effect models meta-analysis served to pool data. We identified eleven case-control studies (319 IA cases and 835 controls). There was an increased risk of IA among recipients with underlying chronic lung diseases (odds ratio [OR] = 7.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-50.06) and among those with diabetic nephropathy (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.10-2.48).

However, the results are not consistent. We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to clarify whether genetically predicted coffee and tea consumption has a causal effect on IA and its subtypes. Methods: Genetic variants associated with coffee and tea consumption (cups/day) were obtained from large genome-wide association studies (GWASs), up to 349,376 subjects. Summary-level data for IA were adopted from a GWAS in 79,429 subjects (23 cohorts, 7495 cases, and 71,934 controls). Results: Genetically predicted coffee consumption was associated with a higher risk of any IA and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but not with unruptured IA. The ORs per 1 cup/day increase in genetically predicted coffee consumption were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.09–1.86; P = 0.010) for IA, 1.51 (95% CI: 1.13–2.03; P = 0.005) for aneurysmal SAH, and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.74–1.96; P = 0.460) for unruptured IA. Genetically predicted tea consumption was not associated with risk of any IA and its subtypes (P > 0.05). The associations remained consistent in sensitivity analyses, and no evidence of pleiotropy was detected. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence to support that coffee consumption may increase the risk of IA and associated hemorrhage.

It is unknown which strategy is associated with better short- and long-term outcomes.Methods:Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling and propensity score-matched analysis was used to compare the overall survival of patients with stage IA NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2015 who underwent ""early"" SBRT (0-30 days after diagnosis) versus that of patients who underwent ""delayed"" wedge resection (90-120 days after diagnosis).Results:During the study period, 570 (55%) patients underwent early SBRT and 475 (45%) underwent delayed wedge resection. In multivariable analysis, delayed resection was associated with improved survival [adjusted hazard ratio 0.61; (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-0.76)]. Propensity-score matching was used to create 2 groups of 279 patients each who received early SBRT or delayed resection that were well-matched with regard to baseline characteristics. The 5-year survival associated with delayed resection was 53% (95% CI: 45%-61%) which was better than the 5-year survival associated with early SBRT (31% [95% CI: 24%-37%]).Conclusion:In this national analysis, for patients with stage IA NSCLC, extended delay of surgery was associated with improved survival when compared to early treatment with SBRT. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Research has demonstrated that PTSD is linked with addiction-related symptoms. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the linkage between PTSD symptoms and Internet addiction (IA) symptoms that have included a large sample of children and adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the comorbidity of IA and PTSD among a large sample of Chinese students exposed to COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns by conducting a network analysis. Method: The data used in this study was extracted from six-month follow-up data from a longitudinal study that included 7958 Chinese adolescents. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess IA and PTSD symptoms. Network analysis was conducted on 31 items: 19 items from the IA community and 12 from the PTSD community. Results: This study found that symptoms from the same community cluster were more closely related. Four key bridge symptoms were identified: sleep problems, concentration difficulties, irritability, and withdrawal distress. In the PTSD-only network, central symptoms were avoiding reminders, easy reminding, avoiding thoughts, and startled. Conclusions: The estimated network structure of PTSD and IA symptoms highlighted key bridge symptoms that are more influential than others on comorbidity maintenance. These symptoms could be targeted in clinical practice to better alleviate the suffering of children and adolescents. Interventions could focus on vital symptoms including alleviating sleep problems, concentration difficulties, irritability, and withdrawal distress to decrease the comorbidity of IA and PTSD. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; children; COVID-19; Internet addiction; posttraumatic stress disorder","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179968720"

Previous research has focused on the enabling effect of negative cognitions and emotions on IA, and has seldom considered the inhibitors of IA. This research tries to fill the gap by integrating a dual perspective of both enablers and inhibitors. Drawing on the cognitive dissonance theory (CDT) and psychological empowerment theory (PET), this research examined social media users’ IA. We adopted a mixed method of structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to conduct data analysis. The results showed that social support (SS) and information quality (IQ) affect psychological empowerment (PE), which further inhibits IA. In contrast, social comparison (SC), and perceived overload (PO) affect cognitive dissonance, which leads to IA. The fsQCA results found three paths that trigger users’ IA. The results imply that social media platforms need to mitigate cognitive dissonance and enhance PE in order to prevent users’ IA. This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the development process of IA. The limitation is that the results need to be generalized to other samples, such as the elderly. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cognitive dissonance; information avoidance; psychological empowerment; Social media","Cognitive dissonance; Cognitive dissonance theories; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Information avoidance; Information behaviours; Passive information; Psychological empowerments; Social media; Social media platforms; User information; Social networking (online)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","English","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171693075"

Traditional methods of analyzing RNA-sequencing data may not be sufficient for unraveling complicated interactions between viruses and host cells. Using RNA and DNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we aim to explore whether virus-induced tumors exhibit similar immune-associated (IA) dysregulations using a new algorithm we developed that focuses on the most important biological mechanisms involved in virus-induced cancers. Differential expression, survival correlation, and clinical variable correlations were used to identify the most clinically relevant IA genes dysregulated in 5 virus-induced cancers (HPV-induced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, HPV-induced cervical cancer, EBV-induced stomach cancer, HBV-induced liver cancer, and HCV-induced liver cancer) after which a mechanistic approach was adopted to identify pathways implicated in IA gene dysregulation. Results: Our results revealed that IA dysregulations vary with the cancer type and the virus type, but cytokine signaling pathways are dysregulated in all virus-induced cancers. Furthermore, we also found that important similarities exist between all 5 virus-induced cancers in dysregulated clinically relevant oncogenic signatures and IA pathways. Finally, we also discovered potential mechanisms for genomic alterations to induce IA gene dysregulations using our algorithm. Conclusions: Our study offers a new approach to mechanism identification through integrating functional annotations and large-scale sequencing data, which may be invaluable to the discovery of new immunotherapy targets for virus-induced cancers. © 2021","Algorithm; Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma; Epstein-Barr virus; Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Human papillomavirus; Liver hepatocellular carcinoma; Stomach adenocarcinoma; TCGA","Bioinformatics; Cytology; Diseases; DNA sequences; Gene encoding; RNA; STAT1 protein; STAT3 protein; Cancer genome; Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma; Epstein-Barr virus; Head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Human papilloma virus; Liver hepatocellular carcinoma; Squamous cell carcinoma; Stomach adenocarcinoma; The cancer genome atlas; Article; cancer growth; cancer survival; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; controlled study; cross presentation; cytokine signaling; differential expression analysis; distant metastasis; DNA sequencing; down regulation; female; gene control; gene expression; genomics; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; immune dysregulation; liver cancer; malignant neoplasm; nonhuman; point mutation; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; small cell lung cancer; stomach cancer; survival; tumor-related gene; upregulation; uterine cervix cancer; virus carcinogenesis; virus infection; Viruses","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119905312"

However, there is a severe lack of related research. This study aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon and process of IA among the elderly. The purpose of this paper is to introduce factors that may influence IA in the demographic. Methods: This study employed qualitative descriptive research methods to investigate older adults’ perceptions and experiences of IA. Semi-structured in-depth personal interviews were conducted between March and June 2023 with 36 senior citizens from urban communities in Chongqing, Southwest China. Data were analyzed via inductive content analysis methods. Results: Through data analysis, 2 main categories concerning IA in older adults were identified: risk factors and protective factors. The risk factor categories include 5 individual factors (e.g., Internet as the major avenue for pursuing personal hobbies and interests, etc.), 3 family factors (e.g., household WIFI increasing the risk of prolonged Internet use indoors, etc.), 2 peer factors (e.g., peer recommendation and guidance as catalysts for intensified Internet engagement, etc.), 2 socio-environmental factors (e.g., the widespread daily Internet use spurs offline intolerance, etc.), and 3 Internet platform factors (e.g., the plenitude of online content triggers endless viewing/browsing behaviors, etc.). The category of protective factors encompasses 2 individual factors (e.g., a higher level of perceived risk regarding internet health hazards, etc.) and 2 family factors (e.g., more family commitment, etc.). Conclusions: Older adults’ Internet addictive behaviors are shaped by multiple and complex internal and external factors. A higher level of online health risk perception is a key protective factor to effectively avoid the occurrence and deterioration of IA among the aged, a distinct finding from this study. It is believed that the “individual-family-peer-community” synergy strategy is expected to become an essential direction for IA intervention for older adults, in order to promote healthy Internet use among older adults. © The Author(s) 2024.","Internet addiction; Older adults; Protective factors; Qualitative research; Risk factors","Aged; Behavior, Addictive; China; Humans; Internet; Internet Addiction Disorder; Peer Group; Research Design; addiction; aged; China; human; Internet; internet addiction; methodology; peer group","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185472976"

Data of patients who underwent laparoscopic hemicolectomy from January 2017 to March 2023 were collected and analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) analyses was carried out to minimize the selection bias. Before PSM, a total of 113 patients met the inclusion criteria (39 in the LCC/IA vs. 74 in the LAC/EA). Clinicopathologic characteristics were comparable except for the median number of removed lymph nodes (P = 0.023). LCC/IA was associated with longer operative time, less intraoperative blood loss, and shorter incision length. The rate of 30-day postoperative complications was similar, but the time to first flatus and soft diet was shorter in the LCC/IA. No deaths were reported in either group within 30 days after surgery. Costs of surgical instruments (25,945.8 ± 1,918.0 vs. 23,551.9 ± 2,665.5 RMB; P < 0.01) were higher for the LCC/IA but overall costs were similar (LCC/IA, 43,220.0 ± 4,954.0 vs. LAC/EA, 41,269.2 ± 6,685.9 RMB; P = 0.112). After PSM, 38 patients in the LCC/IA and 63 patients in the LAC/EA were compared. LCC/IA was superior in terms of intraoperative blood loss, incision length, and postoperative functional recovery. There was an extra charge of 2385.0 RMB regarding surgical instruments in the LCC/IA but the overall cost did not reach statistical significance.

This study aimed to assess the effect of inflow angle on the hemodynamics of IAs, as well as its potential ability to predict IA rupture risk. A novel algorithm was developed to build a series of inflow angle models on patient-specific IA models, which were reconstructed from IA 3DRA image data of eleven clinical patients. Fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations were performed to quantify hemodynamic characteristics of the established IA models with various inflow angles. Hemodynamic parameters including wall shear stress (WSS), flow velocity, flow pattern, inflow zone, impingement region, pressure, and energy loss (EL) were calculated and analyzed. It was demonstrated from the analysis that a rise in the IA inflow angle is associated with the following hemodynamic changes: more direct blood flowed into the aneurysm sac, higher velocity at the upside of the aneurysm, upregulated flow velocity and WSS in the aneurysm, more complicated flow patterns, extended inflow zone, the impingement region moving upward from the neck to the apex of the aneurysm, and higher WSS and larger flow velocity at the inflow zone of the IAs. Therefore, the proposed method may be helpful in exploring the hemodynamic variations of IAs with inflow angles. The findings could be conducive to hemodynamic studies on the association between IA inflow angle and its rupture risk. © Copyright © 2020 Mo, Meng, Yang and Li.","computational fluid dynamics; fully coupled fluid-structure interaction; hemodynamics; inflow angle; intracranial aneurysms","algorithm; Article; computational fluid dynamics; digital subtraction angiography; flow rate; hemodynamic parameters; hemodynamics; human; intracranial aneurysm; pressure; shear stress; simulation","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099042968"

This article sought to review studies on the associations among polymorphisms in inflammatory cytokine genes and IA risk and to provide recommendations for future research. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted up to August 4, 2019. The associations between polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokine genes and IA risk were estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed according to race. Qualitative systematic review was conducted for variants that were studied in only one study. All analyses were performed using STATA 12.0. Results: 13 studies investigating the associations between polymorphisms in five inflammatory cytokine genes (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL6, and IL-12B) and IA were reviewed. Combined results showed that the A allele of TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism has a protective effect against IA (dominant model: OR=0.65, 95% CI=0.47–0.89, p=0.007). No associations were identified between poly-morphisms in IL-1α rs1800587, IL-1β rs16944, IL6 rs1800795 and rs1800796, or IL-12B rs3212227 and IA risk.

Methods: IA and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), respectively. The structure of IA and anxiety symptoms was characterized using “Strength” as a centrality index in the symptom network. Network stability was tested using a case-dropping bootstrap procedure and a Network Comparison Test (NCT) was conducted to examine whether network characteristics differed on the basis of gender and by region of residence. Results: A total of 1,070 nursing students participated in the study. Network analysis showed that IAT nodes, “Academic decline due to Internet use,” “Depressed/moody/nervous only while being off-line,” “School grades suffer due to Internet use,” and “Others complain about your time spent online” were the most influential symptoms in the IA-anxiety network model. Gender and urban/rural residence did not significantly influence the overall network structure. Conclusion: Several influential individual symptoms including Academic declines due to Internet use, Depressed/moody/nervous only while being off-line, School grades suffering due to Internet use and Others complain about one's time spent online emerged as potential targets for clinical interventions to reduce co-occurring IA and anxiety. Additionally, the overall network structure provides a data-based hypothesis for explaining potential mechanisms that account for comorbid IA and anxiety. © Copyright © 2021 Cai, Xi, An, Wang, Han, Liu, Zhu, Bai, Zhao, Chen, Ge, Ji, Zhang, Yang, Chen, Cheung, Jackson, Tang and Xiang.","anxiety; internet addiction; network analysis; nursing students; symptoms","adult; anxiety; Article; centrality index; cross-sectional study; depression; disease association; female; Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; human; human experiment; internet addiction; internet addiction test; internet use; male; mental disease assessment; multicenter study; network analysis; nursing student; questionnaire; young adult","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114712679"

This indicates that depression and anxiety may contribute to the development of physical disorders. Herein, to investigate the association between genetic variants related to depression and anxiety and the risk of IA, two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed. Methods: The genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprised genome-wide genotype data of 2248 clinically well-characterized patients with anxiety and 7992 ethnically matched controls from four European countries. Sex-specific summary-level outcome data were obtained from the GWAS of IA, including 23 cohorts with a total of 10,754 cases and 306,882 controls of European and East Asian ancestry. To improve validity, five varying Mendelian randomization techniques were used in the analysis, namely Mendelian randomization–Egger, weighted median, inverse variance weighted, simple mode, and weighted mode. Results: The inverse variance weighted results indicated the causal effect of depression on IA (P = 0.03, OR = 1.32 [95 % CI, 1.03–1.70]) and unruptured IA (UIA) (P = 0.02, OR = 1.68 [95 % CI, 1.08–2.61]). However, the causal relationship between depression and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was not found (P = 0.16). We identified 43 anxiety-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms as genetic instruments and found no causal relationship between anxiety and IA, UIA, and SAH. Limitations: Potential pleiotropy, possible weak instruments, and low statistical power limited our findings. Conclusion: Our MR study suggested a possible causal effect of depression on the increased risk of UIAs. Future research is required to investigate whether rational intervention in depression treatment can help to decrease the societal burden of IAs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; Depression; Intracranial aneurysms; Mendelian randomization; Subarachnoid hemorrhage","Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Depression; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; adult; anxiety; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; disease association; East Asian; European; female; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; genotype; human; intracranial aneurysm; major clinical study; Mendelian randomization analysis; phenotype; single nucleotide polymorphism; subarachnoid hemorrhage; anxiety; anxiety disorder; depression; genetics; genome-wide association study; male","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184170444"

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare two total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anesthesia (IA) to determine if either conferred superior outcomes of these and other parameters based on randomized control trials (RCTs) only. Methods: The recommended Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and searches of electronic databases from inception to September 2018 identified 157 articles for screening. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions. Results: In total, we identified 15 RCTs that satisfied our selection criteria. There were 828 ESS cases described, with 391 (47%) and 437 (53%) being managed by TIVA and IA, respectively. Pooled analysis demonstrated significantly superior visibility scores for TIVA compared to IA based on 10-point grading scores (P = 0.049, visual analog scale; P = 0.009, Wormald scale) and 5-point grading scores (P = 0.002, Boezaart scale). Blood loss was significantly less following TIVA (P = 0.003), with no significant difference in intraoperative heart rate (P = 0.70) or mean arterial pressure (P = 0.96). Additionally, duration of surgery (P = 0.16) and anesthesia (P = 0.39) were comparable between the two approaches. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that TIVA has the potential to confer superior surgical field visibility and reduce intraoperative blood loss compared to IA in ESS. Currently, there are significant heterogeneity concerns in this meta-analysis, which temper any expectations that either approach is absolutely superior to the other. Caution should be exercised when interpreting these results until further validation can be achieved. Level of Evidence: 1A.

The purpose of this study was to reveal the pathogenesis and identify novel biomarkers in IA.We processed the raw microRNA (miRNA) expression profile data of IA obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. Then weighted correlation network analysis was performed to identify the hub miRNAs in IA. Target genes of hub miRNAs were predicted using multiR package. In addition, a protein-protein network as well as miRNA-mRNA network was constructed and functional and pathway enrichment analyses were done. Finally, the prediction value of hub miRNAs in IA was tested in validation set.Two modules that had relation with IA were identified and 10 hub miRNAs in each module with higher gene-module association were selected. The protein-protein network and miRNA-mRNA network contained 243 nodes and 1496 edges. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses showed that they were mainly enriched in cell cycle, cell proliferation, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Besides, hsa-miR-191-3p, hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-425-3p were proven to be valuable in prediction IA occurrence.In a word, this study reveals hub miRNAs, target genes and pathways potentially participating in formation and development of IA and screens out some candidate biomarkers.

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive mucormycosis (IM) are two of the most common mold infections. A better understanding of patient comorbidities and risk factors that predispose IMI may help clinicians to refine the difficult diagnostic and treatment process. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted (January 2008- October 2019) for studies reporting comorbidities/risk factors of patients with IA or IM (Phase I), followed by an analysis on the Optum® US EHR database of prominent risk factor cohorts based on SLR findings and expert opinion (Phase II). From the four identified patient cohorts: 1) patients undergoing solid organ transplant (SOT) and patients with 2) hematologic cancers, 3) diabetes, or 4) lung disease, rates of IA, IM, or concurrent IA and IM; patient comorbidities; and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were reported. Results: The SLR included 88 studies, and 46 were used to select comorbidities/risk factors cohorts in IA and IM patients. The most important comorbidities/risk factors in IA and IM patients were diabetes, lung disease, hematological malignances, and SOT. In the Optum database (N=101,340,454 patients), IA rates were highest in lung transplant (10.81%) patients and IM rates were highest in intestine transplant (0.83%) patients, lung transplant (0.43%), and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (0.49%). CCI scores were elevated in all mold infection groups compared to the total Optum cohort. Conclusion: The current study describes patient comorbidity and risk factors associated with IA and IM. These data can be used to refine clinical decision-making regarding when to suspect mold infections. Future research should focus on identifying whether patients respond differently to various antifungal treatments to determine if strategic recommendations should be made for certain patient groups. © 2021 Sung et al.","Invasive aspergillosis; Invasive mold infections; Invasive mucormycosis; Retrospective claims data; Systematic literature review","","","Dove Medical Press Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109579211"

Acupuncture is an effective therapy for Internet addiction (IA). However, the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture in relieving compulsive Internet use remain unknown. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the role of the ventral striatum (VS) in the progress of IA; hence, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of acupuncture on the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and relevant network of VS in IA. Methods. Twenty-seven IA individuals and 30 demographically matched healthy control subjects (HCs) were recruited in this study. We acquired the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in IA subjects before and after 40 days of acupuncture treatment. Seed-to-voxel and ROI-to-ROI analyses were applied to detect the rsFC alterations of the VS and related network in IA subjects and to investigate the modulation effect of acupuncture on the rsFC. Results. Compared with HCs, IA subjects exhibited enhanced rsFC of the right ventral rostral putamen (VRP) with the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), premotor cortex (PMC), cerebellum, and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). In the network including these five ROIs, IA also showed increased ROI-to-ROI rsFC. Using a paired t-test in IA subjects before and after 40 days of acupuncture, the increased ROI-to-ROI rsFC was decreased (normalized to HC) with acupuncture, including the rsFC of the right VRP with the left OFC, PMC, and cerebellum, and the rsFC of the left cerebellum with the left OFC, PMC, and right vmPFC. Furthermore, the change in rsFC strength between the right VRP and left cerebellum in IA individuals was found positively correlated with the Internet craving alleviation after acupuncture. Conclusions. These findings verified the modulation effect of acupuncture on functional connectivity of reward and habit systems related to the VS in IA individuals, which might partly represent the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture on IA. © 2020 Yang Wang et al.","","Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Habits; Humans; Internet Addiction Disorder; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Reward; Young Adult; acupuncture; adolescent; adult; Article; cerebellum; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; craving; demography; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; habit; human; internet addiction; male; orbital cortex; premotor cortex; putamen; resting state network; reward; treatment response; ventral striatum; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; brain; brain mapping; internet addiction; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; young adult","","Hindawi Limited","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082744428"

In this study, we examined the degree of anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) epitope expansion in CCP+ICI-IA and patients with RA. Methods: We used clinical data and serum from ICI-IA and patients with RA with early disease as well as longstanding disease. A custom, bead-based antigen array was used to identify IgG ACPA reactivities to 18 putative RA-associated citrullinated proteins. Hierarchical clustering software was used to create a heatmap to identify ACPA levels. Additionally, HLA DRB1 typing was performed on ICI-IA patients as well as controls of patients treated with ICI that did not develop ICI-IA (ICI controls). Results: Compared to patients with CCP+RA, patients with CCP+ICI-IA were older (p<0.001), less likely to have positive rheumatoid factor (p<0.001) and had a shorter duration of symptoms (p<0.001). There were less ACPA levels and a lower number of distinct ACPA epitopes in the serum of patients with ICI-IA compared with longstanding patients with RA (p<0.001). Among those tested for HLA DRB1, there were no differences in the frequency of the shared epitope between those with ICI-IA and ICI controls. Conclusion: Patients with ICI-IA had lower ACPA titres and targeted fewer ACPA epitopes than longstanding patients with RA, and there were no significant differences in the presence of the shared epitope between those that developed ICI-IA and ICI controls. It remains to be determined if ICI-IA represents an accelerated model of RA pathogenesis with ICI triggering a transition from preclinical to clinical disease.  © 2023 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies; Arthritis; Rheumatoid Arthritis","Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies; Arthritis; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Epitopes; HLA-DRB1 Chains; Humans; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Peptides; Peptides, Cyclic; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; HLA DRB1 antigen; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; cyclopeptide; epitope; HLA DRB1 antigen; immune checkpoint inhibitor; peptide; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease duration; female; HLA system; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; prospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; arthritis; genetics","","BMJ Publishing Group","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162828089"

However, sex differences in IA among patients with SCZ mostly remain unstudied, particularly in Chinese adolescent patients with SCZ. This study investigated sex differences in prevalence, risk factors, and clinical correlates of IA among Chinese adolescent patients with SCZ. Methods: A total of 706 adolescent patients with SCZ were enrolled in this study using a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method. Demographics and clinical data of the patients were collected using a standardized clinical assessment form. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Young’s Internet Addiction Test were used to evaluate psychopathological symptoms and IA respectively. Results: Overall, the prevalence of IA among Chinese adolescent patients with SCZ was 26.30% (95% CI: 23.09-29.60%). In Chinese adolescents with SCZ, there was a sex difference in the comorbidity of IA (males: 33.33% vs. females: 21.69%). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that IA was significantly predicted by good socioeconomic status in male and female patients with SCZ. City of living and PANSS total score were associated with IA in male patients with SCZ. In contrast, hospitalization rate and depression score were associated with IA in female patients with SCZ.

Objective To investigate the feasibility of using deep neural networks (DNNs) and API to predict IA occlusion using pre- and post-intervention DSAs. Methods We analyzed DSA images of IAs pre- and post-treatment to extract API parameters in the IA dome and the corresponding main artery (un-normalized data). We implemented a two-step correction to account for injection variability (normalized data) and projection foreshortening (relative data). A DNN was trained to predict a binary IA occlusion outcome: occluded/unoccluded. Network performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and classification accuracy. To evaluate the effect of the proposed corrections, prediction accuracy analysis was performed after each normalization step. Results The study included 190 IAs. The mean and median duration between treatment and follow-up was 9.8 and 8.0 months, respectively. For the un-normalized, normalized, and relative subgroups, the DNN average prediction accuracies for IA occlusion were 62.5% (95% CI 60.5% to 64.4%), 70.8% (95% CI 68.2% to 73.4%), and 77.9% (95% CI 76.2% to 79.6%). The average AUROCs for the same subgroups were 0.48 (0.44-0.52), 0.67 (0.61-0.73), and 0.77 (0.74-0.80).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a single image modality solution for both morphological and hemodynamic measurements for IA. This study aimed to explore the interaction between the morphology and hemodynamics of IA using black-blood MRI (BB-MRI) and 4D flow MRI. Methods: A total of 97 patients with unruptured IA were recruited for this study. The IA size, size ratio (SR), and minimum wall thickness (mWT) were measured using BB-MRI. Velocity, blood flow, pulsatility index (PI), and wall shear stress (WSS) were measured with 4D flow MRI. The relationship between hemodynamic parameters and morphological indices was investigated by linear regression analysis and unpaired two-sample t-test. To determine the independent interaction, multiple linear regression analysis was further performed. Results: The findings showed that mWT was negatively correlated with IA size (r=-0.665, P<0.001). Maximum blood flow in IA (FlowIA) was positively correlated with IA size (r=0.458, P<0.001). The average WSS (WSSavg) was negatively correlated with IA size (r=-0.650, P<0.001). The relationships remained the same after the multivariate analysis was adjusted for hemodynamic, morphologic, and demographic confounding factors. The WSSavg was positively correlated with mWT (r=0.528, P<0.001). In the unpaired two-sample t-test, mWT, WSSavg, and FlowIA were statistically significantly associated with the size and SR of IAs. Conclusions: There is potential for BB-MRI and 4D flow MRI to provide morphological and hemodynamic information regarding IA. Blood flow, WSS, and mWT may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for IA assessments, and may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of IA. © 2021 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.","4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow MRI); Black-blood magnetic resonance imaging (BB-MRI); Intracranial aneurysm (IA)","4D flow nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; adult; aged; artery diameter; Article; black blood nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; data analysis software; digital subtraction angiography; female; hemodynamic parameters; hemodynamics; human; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; morphology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pulsatility index; quantitative analysis; shear stress; unruptured intracranial aneurysm","","AME Publishing Company","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098799922"

Common image classification and recognition models classify the objects in an image depending on the saliency while suppressing the background. In this article, an inception-attention network (IA-Net), a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model to classify the underwater images from natural images is reported, in which an inception-attention (I-A) module is constructed to simulate the visual correlation mechanism of classifying images taken from special environments such as fog, nighttime and under water. It is illustrated that the context background is as important as the salient object when understanding the underwater images. We executed experiments on a data set, which consists of 4000 underwater images and 5000 nonunderwater images, and demonstrate that the proposed IA-Net achieves an accuracy of 99.3% on underwater image classification, which is significantly better than classical image classification networks, such as AlexNet, InceptionV3, and ResNet. In addition, the comparative experiments prove that the IA-Net is superior to other networks when distinguishing underwater images from foggy, nighttime images and fish images taken in nonunderwater environments, although these images have indistinguishable characteristics with underwater images. Moreover, we demonstrate the I-A structure we proposed can be used to boost the performance of the existing object recognition networks. By substituting the inception module with the I-A module, the Inception-ResNetV2 network achieves a 10.7% top-1 error rate on the subset of ILSVRC-2012, which further illustrates the effectiveness of the correlation between the image background and subjective perception in improving the performance of the visual analysis tasks.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Attention module; convolutional neural network (CNN); image classification; inception module; underwater image","Classification (of information); Convolution; Data visualization; Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Job analysis; Neural networks; Object recognition; Attention module; Convolutional neural network; Images classification; Inception module; Kernel; Natural images; Performance; Task analysis; Underwater image; Image recognition","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124729906"

Influence path characteristics, regional heterogeneity effects and development trends of three major IA on the HP are systematically investigated. The results show that: (1) IA significantly correlated to HP in the BSER. The Siphon Effect in Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang region plays an important role in the HP and IA, and it weakened with the upgrading of industrial structure and industrial transfer. (2) Both IA and HP have significant spatial autocorrelation properties, the agglomeration and diffusion properties of IA and HP in specific regions are consistent along the time series.

Interestingly, IA of the third industry has a significant nonlinear effect on HP.

Methods: The bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets of hypertension and IA were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) database. These data were then used to calculate disease-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the individual level. An scRNA-seq dataset of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) was used to analyze monocyte/macrophage-related DEGs. On the basis of the DEG data related to monocytes and macrophages, a TF-genes network has been developed. Hub genes and core sub-networks have also been identified. Furthermore, the key genes have been validated in an external cohort. Results: From combined monocyte and macrophage-derived DEGs from abdominal aortic aneurysms, five hub DEGs were detected, including IFI30, SERPINE1, HMOX1, IL24, and RUNX1. A total of 57 genes were found in the IA bulk RNA-seq dataset. A support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm (SVM-RFE) was applied to further screen the seven genes (RPS4Y1, DDX3Y, RUNX1, CLEC10A, PLAC8, SLA, and LILRB3). RUNX1 was the hub gene that regulated NFKB1 in the monocyte/macrophage-related network. And RUNX1 is implicated in IA progression by regulating hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and abnormal platelet production, according to gene set enrichment analysis. Conclusion: Among patients with hypertension, RUNX1 in monocytes and macrophages was associated with a higher risk of IA through its regulation of NFKB1.

However, the common biometric analysis based on the combination of EEG signals and results of questionnaires is not quantitative, and thus difficult to ensure a specific biomarker. This work aims to develop a deep learning algorithm (no need to identify biomarkers) used for diagnosing IA and evaluating therapy efficacy. Herein, a five-layer CNN model combined with a fast Fourier transform is proposed to diagnose IA quantitatively. This algorithm is validated in the Lemon dataset by using it to process raw data, full spectral power, and alpha-beta-gamma spectral power (related to IA). In contrast to alpha-beta-gamma spectral power, the results based on full spectral power show better performance (87.59% accuracy, 88.80% sensitivity, and 86.41% specificity), which confirms that the proposed algorithm can diagnose IA without biomarkers. In addition, this proposed CNN model presents obvious advantages in processing raw data, achieving 81.1% accuracy. Such results verify that this method can contribute to the reduction of diagnosis time and be potentially used in real-time health monitoring systems. This work provides a quantitative approach to diagnose IA and evaluate therapy efficacy, as a general strategy, and can be widely used in other disorder diagnoses that affect EEG signals, such as psychiatric disorders, substance dependence, and depression. © 2022 by the authors.

The underlying molecular mechanisms for preventing IA progression have not been fully identified. Our research aimed to identify the key genes and critical pathways of IA through gene co-expression networks. Methods: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE13353, GSE54083 and GSE75436 were used in the study. The genetic data were analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Then the clinically significant modules were identified and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the genes were intersected in these modules. GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Gene and Genomic Encyclopedia) were used for gene enrichment analysis to determine the function or pathway. In addition, the composition of immune cells was analyzed by CIBERSORT algorithm. Finally, the hub genes and key genes were identified by GSE122897. Results: A total of 266 DEGs and two modules with clinical significance were identified. The inflammatory response and immune response were identified by GO and KEGG. CCR5, CCL4, CCL20, and FPR3 were the key genes in the module correlated with IA. The proportions of infiltrating immune cells in IA and normal tissues were different, especially in terms of macrophages and mast cells.

Given the limitations of previous cross-sectional design, longitudinal research was necessary to be conducted to explore more precise correlations. Using the three-wave data in a longitudinal design, this study aimed to explore the association between FV and IA among Chinese college students and potential multiple mediators of insomnia and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 579 college students were recruited during three waves (T1: August 2020; T2: November 2020; T3: February 2021). FV (T1), insomnia (T2), depression (T2) and IA (T3) symptoms were reported. The descriptive statistics of the sociodemographic characteristics and correlation analyses of the study variables were calculated. The significance of the mediation effects was measured conducting a bootstrap method with SPSS PROCESS macro. Results: FV was negatively correlated with IA, and lower FV predicted higher risk of IA. Depression mediated the association between FV and subsequent IA. Insomnia and depression were multiple mediators, which in turn mediated the links between FV and subsequent IA. Conclusions: The three-wave longitudinal study has revealed that FV had indirect effects on IA through individual mediating factor of depression and multiple mediating roles of insomnia and depression sequentially. The policy makers, educators and researchers should pay attention to the impact of the interventions from healthy diet, in order to optimize the coping strategies for preventing college students from IA. © 2023, The Author(s).","Depression; Fruit and vegetable consumption; Insomnia; Internet addiction; Longitudinal study; Multiple mediation model","Behavior, Addictive; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Fruit; Humans; Internet; Internet Addiction Disorder; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Students; Vegetables; adult; Article; Chinese; college student; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; depression; disease association; female; fruit consumption; healthy diet; high risk patient; human; insomnia; internet addiction; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mental health; pandemic; prediction; social status; vegetable consumption; addiction; cross-sectional study; depression; fruit; insomnia; Internet; internet addiction; student; vegetable","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179715355"

In order to avoid the mutual interference, source separation of the aliasing signal is a promising solution for joint communication and radar (JCR) sensing. However, most of the existing source separation methods are very sensitive to wide-band signals with rapidly varying instantaneous amplitude (IA) and not applicable to scenarios with complex overlapping subsignals. To overcome the above limitations, a data-driven sparsity-based source separation method is proposed. Without depending on signal parameters, a sparse signal observation model of the received signal is established. Then, source separation is transformed into estimation of the IA and instantaneous frequency (IF), and an iterative method is developed. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the source separation error (SSE) variance is derived based on the CRLB of IA and IF. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to the benchmark schemes and is robust to noise and initial IF errors.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.","CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound; data-driven; Joint communication and radar sensing; source separation","Chirp modulation; Frequency estimation; Iterative methods; Radar; Separation; Source separation; Chirp; Crame-Rao lower bounds; Cramer Rao lower bound; Data driven; Instantaneous amplitude; Joint communication and radar sensing; Matrix decomposition; Radar sensing; Time-frequency Analysis; Wide-band; Frequency modulation","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139834614"

Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a fatal disease owing to vascular rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Much attention has been given to circular RNAs (circRNAs) because they may be potential biomarkers for many diseases, but their mechanism in the formation of IA remains unknown. Methods. circRNA expression profile analysis of blood samples was conducted between patients with IA and controls. Overall, 235 differentially expressed circRNAs were confirmed between IA patients andthe control group. The reliability of the microarray results was demonstrated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results. Of 235 differentially expressed genes, 150 wereupregulated, while the other 85 were downregulated. Five miRNAs matched to every differential expression of circRNAs, and related MREs were predicted. We performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to identify the functions of their targeted genes, with the terms ""Homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules""and ""Positive regulation of cellular process""showingthe highest fold enrichment. Conclusions. This study demonstrated the role of circRNA expression profiling in the formation of IA and revealed that the mTOR pathway can be a latent therapeutic strategy for IA.  © 2021 Yonggang Ma et al.","","Adult; Case-Control Studies; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Computational Biology; Computed Tomography Angiography; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Ontology; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Circular; cell adhesion molecule; circular ribonucleic acid; cell adhesion molecule; microRNA; adult; Article; blood sampling; cell adhesion; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; data analysis software; DNA microarray; down regulation; gene expression; gene ontology; gene targeting; human; intracranial aneurysm; microarray analysis; middle aged; predictive value; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory mechanism; upregulation; biology; case control study; classification; computed tomographic angiography; diagnostic imaging; DNA microarray; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; intracranial aneurysm; male; metabolism; molecular genetics; pathology; procedures","","Hindawi Limited","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100644000"

The present study aims at evaluating the association between circulating inflammatory cytokines and risk of IA under a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Methods: For primary analysis, summary statistics of inflammatory regulators was obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 8293 Finnish participants. Summary data of IA were extracted from a GWAS which comprised 7495 cases and 71,934 controls in European descent. For targeted analysis, summary statistics were extracted from two proteomic studies, which recruit 3301 and 5368 European participants, respectively. Summary data of IA were acquired from FinnGen study with 5342 cases and 342,673 controls. We employed inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as main approach, with sensitivity analyses using weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO methods. Reverse MR analyses were conducted to minimize bias from reverse causality. Results: No causation of cytokines with IA subtypes was identified in both primary and targeted analysis after Bonferroni correction. In primary analysis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor basic (bFGF) levels were suggestively associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) [VEGF → aSAH: OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.04–1.26, P = 0.005; bFGF → aSAH: OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.42–0.92, P = 0.02]. Statistical significance failed to replicate in targeted analysis. Instead, suggestive protective effects for aSAH were identified in FGF-9 (FGF-9 → aSAH: OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.62–0.89, P = 0.001) and FGF-16 (FGF-16 → aSAH: OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.72–0.97, P = 0.017). Furthermore, reverse analyses identified suggestive effect of unruptured IA on RANTES, MIF, GRO-alpha, FGF-16, and FGF-19. Result remained robust after applying sensitivity tests. Conclusions: No causality of inflammatory biomarkers on the risk of IA subtypes was identified. Future large-scale studies are in need to evaluate the temporal dynamics of cytokines in conjunction with IA. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cytokines; Inflammation; Intracranial aneurysm; Mendelian randomization","Biomarkers; Cytokines; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Proteomics; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; biological marker; CXCL1 chemokine; fibroblast growth factor 16; fibroblast growth factor 19; fibroblast growth factor 2; fibroblast growth factor 9; macrophage migration inhibition factor; RANTES; vasculotropin; biological marker; cytokine; vasculotropin A; Article; causality; disease association; European; Finn (citizen); genome-wide association study; human; inflammation; intracranial aneurysm; Mendelian randomization analysis; protein blood level; proteomics; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; subarachnoid hemorrhage; genetics","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181249102"

Various IA schemes have been proposed based on different behavioral and contextual features such as gait, touch, and GPS. However, existing IA schemes suffer from false positives, i.e., falsely accepting an adversary, and false negatives, i.e., falsely rejecting the legitimate user due to users' behavior change and noise. To deal with this problem, we propose BubbleMap (BMap), a framework that can be seamlessly incorporated into any existing IA system to balance between security (reducing false positives) and usability (reducing false negatives) as well as reducing the equal error rate (EER). To evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented BMap on five state-of-the-art IA systems. We also conducted an experiment in a real-world environment from 2016 to 2020. Most of the experimental results show that BMap can greatly enhance the IA schemes' performances in terms of the EER, security, and usability, with a small amount of penalty on energy consumption. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","continuous authentication; Implicit authentication; mobile security; security","Energy utilization; Error analysis; Authentication scheme; Authentication systems; False negatives; False positive; Implicit authentications; Password; Security; Sensor phenomenon and characterizations; Smart devices; Usability; Authentication","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128683465"

Backpropagation (BP) neural network could be adopted to support clinical work. This preliminary study aimed to delve into the feasibility of BP neural network in assessing the risk of IA rupture/growth and to prove the advantage of multidimensional model over single/double-dimensional model. Methods: Thirty-six IA patients were recruited from a prospective registration study (ChiCTR1900024547). All patients were followed up until aneurysm ruptured/grew or 36 months after being diagnosed with the IAs. The multidimensional data regarding clinical, morphological, and hemodynamic characteristics were acquired. Hemodynamic analyses were conducted with patient-specific models. Based on these characteristics, seven models were built with BP neural network (the ratio of training set to validation set as 8:1). The area under curves (AUC) was calculated for subsequent comparison. Results: Forty-five characteristics were determined from 36 patients with 37 IAs. In the models based on the single dimension of IA characteristics, only morphological characteristics exhibited high performance in assessing 3-year IA stability (AUC = 0.703, P = 0.035). Among the models integrating two dimensions of IA characteristics, clinical-morphological (AUC = 0.731, P = 0.016), clinical-hemodynamic (AUC = 0.702, P = 0.036), and morphological-hemodynamic (AUC = 0.785, P = 0.003) models were capable of assessing the risk of 3-year IA rupture/growth. Moreover, the models including all three dimensions exhibited the maximum predicting significance (AUC = 0.811, P = 0.001). Conclusion: The present preliminary study reported that BP neural network might support assessing the 3-year stability of IAs. Models based on multidimensional characteristics could improve the assessment accuracy for IA rupture/growth. © 2021, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.","Backpropagation neural network; Intracranial aneurysm; Multidimensional predicting model; Stability","Aneurysm, Ruptured; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Neural Networks, Computer; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; adult; aneurysm rupture; aneurysm volume; Article; back propagation neural network; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease duration; feasibility study; female; follow up; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; internal carotid artery; intracranial aneurysm; ischemic heart disease; ischemic stroke; male; middle aged; morphological trait; prospective study; shear stress; surface property; unruptured intracranial aneurysm; aneurysm rupture; diagnostic imaging; intracranial aneurysm; retrospective study","","Springer-Verlag Italia s.r.l.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102882557"

These systems undergo through a metamorphosis as a result of the Industry 4.0 revolution, which emphasises enhanced connectivity and flexibility with the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies. As the data is transferred across the Internet, Industry 4.0 communication can be easily attacked by launching different potential attacks. As a consequence, we attempt to propose a novel certificate-based access control and key establishment scheme for securing Industry 4.0 communication, called ACKS-IA. It offers access control and key establishment between smart industrial devices, as well as between a smart device and its associated cloud server. A formal security analysis of ACKS-IA through the broadly-accepted Burrows-Abadi- Needham (BAN) logic is provided. It confirms that ACKS-IA is secured and provides secure mutual authentication among the communication entities. The detailed informal security analysis and comparative study with the existing related schemes reveal that the proposed ACKS-IA is secured and efficient in terms of communication cost, computation cost, and security and functionality features including anonymity and untraceability as compared to other competing schemes. Finally, a real testbed implementation of ACKS-IA is provided to measure its effect on important performance attributes.  © 2013 IEEE.","Access control; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things (IoT); key agreement; security; testbed experiments","Authentication; Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Network security; Security systems; Testbeds; Cloud-computing; Computational modelling; Fourth industrial revolution; Industrial revolutions; Internet of thing; Key agreement; Key agreement scheme; Security; Testbed experiment; Cloud computing","","IEEE Computer Society","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165266206"

We investigated the utility of image analysis (IA) to quantify CD8+ T cells in a series of matched small biopsies and resections of NSCLC. Methods: CD8 immunohistochemistry was performed on cell-blocks (CB), core needle biopsies (CNB) and corresponding resections from primary NSCLCs. Slides were digitised using an Aperio AT2 scanner (Leica) and annotated by whole slide image (WSI) or fields of view occupied by tissue spots (TS). Quantitative IA was performed with a customised Aperio algorithm (Leica). CD8 scores (number of T cells with 1-3+ staining/total area) were then compared. Results: Forty-four cases with CB or CNB material and a corresponding resection were analysed. Average CD8 score was determined in CB (7.67 WSI, 77.67 TS) and/or CNB (47.35 WSI, 325.67 TS), and corresponding resections (190.35 WSI, 336.58 TS). CD8 score concordance was highest (78.6%) for CNBs using WSI annotation. Overall, small biopsies (CB or CNB) correlated with the resection in 71.4% cases using WSI and 63.3% cases using TS annotation. IA performed better for low CD8 scores. Conclusions: These findings show that CD8 density in NSCLC can be quantified by IA in small biopsies and cell blocks, achieving the best concordance using WSI scores. Discrepancies were attributed to values near the cut-off and background detection of staining.

Although > 70% of patients in the trials assessing EVT for AIS-LVO had successful recanalization, only a third ultimately achieved favorable outcomes. A “no-reflow” phenomenon due to distal microcirculation disruption might contribute to such suboptimal outcomes. Combining intra-arterial (IA) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and EVT to reduce the distal microthrombi burden was investigated in a few studies. We present a pooled-data meta-analysis of the existing evidence of this combinatorial treatment. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. We aimed to include all original studies investigating EVT plus IA tPA in AIS-LVO patients. Using R software, we calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed-effects model was adopted to evaluate pooled data. Results: Five studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Successful recanalization was comparable between the IA tPA and control groups at 82.9% and 82.32% respectively. The 90-day functional independence was similar between both groups (OR= 1.25; 95% CI= 0.92-1.70; P= 0.154). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) was also comparable between both groups (OR= 0.66; 95% CI= 0.34-1.26; P= 0.304). Conclusion: Our current meta-analysis does not show significant differences between EVT alone and EVT plus IA tPA in terms of functional independence or sICH. However, with the limited number of studies and included patients, more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to further investigate the benefits and safety of combined EVT and IA tPA. © 2023","Endovascular thrombectomy; Intra-arterial thrombolysis; Ischemic stroke; Large vessel occlusion","Functional Status; Humans; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Ischemic Stroke; Thrombectomy; Thrombolytic Therapy; placebo; tissue plasminogen activator; acute ischemic stroke; adult; aged; Article; blood clot lysis; blood vessel occlusion; brain hemorrhage; controlled study; drug safety; female; human; large vessel occlusion; large vessel occlusion; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; middle aged; outcome assessment; percutaneous thrombectomy; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; recanalization; systematic review; diagnostic imaging; fibrinolytic therapy; functional status; ischemic stroke; thrombectomy","","W.B.

However, longitudinal information can often be inferred from cross-sectional datasets as demonstrated by ana-tomists’ use of geometric morphometrics to build evolutionary trees, reconstructing species inter-re-lationships based on morphologic landmarks. Objective: We adopted these tools to analyze cross-sectional image data and infer relationships between IA morphologies. Methods: On 3D reconstructions of 52 middle cerebral arteries (MCA) IAs (9 ruptured) and 10 IA-free MCAs (baseline geometries), 7 semi-automated landmarks were placed at the proximal parent artery and maximum height. From these, 64 additional landmarks were computationally generated to create a 71-landmark point cloud of 213 xyz coordinates. This data was normalized by Procrustes transformation and used in the principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and phylogenetic analyses. Results: Principal component analysis showed separation of IA-free MCA geometries and group-ing of ruptured IAs from unruptured IAs. Hierarchical clustering delineated a cluster of only unrup-tured IAs that were significantly smaller and more spherical than clusters that had ruptured IAs. Phylogenetic classification placed ruptured IAs more distally in the tree than unruptured IAs, indi-cating greater shape derivation. Groups of unruptured IAs were observed, but ruptured IAs were in-variably found in mixed lineages with unruptured IAs, suggesting that some pathways of shape change may be benign while others are more associated with rupture. Conclusion: Geometric morphometric analyses of larger datasets may indicate particular pathways of shape change leading toward aneurysm rupture versus stabilization. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cerebral aneurysm; Geometric morphometrics; Longitudinal data; Natural history; Phylogenetic analysis; Subarachnoid hemorrhage","Aged; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Cerebral Artery; adult; aged; anatomic landmark; Article; brain artery aneurysm; brain artery aneurysm rupture; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; female; geometry; hierarchical clustering; history; human; major clinical study; male; middle cerebral artery; morphometry; phylogeny; principal component analysis; priority journal; three-dimensional imaging; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; intracranial aneurysm; middle aged","","Bentham Science Publishers","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102280979"

In this study, bioinformatics methods were used to identify the potential hub genes and pathways associated with the pathogenesis of IA. Methods: The gene expression datasets of patients with intracranial aneurysm were down-loaded from the Gene Expression Database (GEO), and the different data sets were integrated by the robust rank aggregation (RRA) method to identify the differentially expressed genes between patients with intracranial aneurysm and the controls. The functional enrichment analyses of the significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed and the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed; thereafter, the hub genes werscreened by cytoHubba plug-in of Cytoscape, and finally sequencing dataset GSE122897 was used to verify the hub genes. Results: The GSE15629, GSE75436, GSE26969, and GSE6551 expression profiles havbeen included in this study, including 34 intracranial aneurysm samples and 26 controsamples. The four datasets obtained 136 significant DEGs (45 up-regulated, 91 down-regulated). Enrichment analysis showed that the extracellular matrix structural constituenand the ECM-receptor interaction were closely related to the occurrence of IA. It was finally determined that eight hub genes associated with the development of IA, including VCANCOL1A1, COL11A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, POSTN, THBS2, and CDH2. Conclusion: The discovery of potential hub genes and pathways could enhance the under-standing of the molecular mechanisms associated with the development of IA.

However, these studies were based on single aneurysm model and were limited to side-wall aneurysms. Purpose: To investigate the association between inflow angle and morphology, hemodynamic, and inflammation of intracranial side-wall and bifurcation aneurysms. Study type: Prospective. Population: A total of 62 patients (aged 58.34 ± 12.39, 44 female) with 59 unruptured side-wall aneurysms and 17 unruptured bifurcation aneurysms were included. Field strength/sequence: A 3.0 T; 3D fast field echo sequence (TOF-MRA); free-breathing, 3D radio-frequency-spoiled, multi-shot turbo field echo sequence (4D-flow MRI); 3D black-blood T1-weighted volumetric turbo spin echo acquisition sequence (T1-VISTA). Assessment: Two neuroradiologists assessed the inflow angle and size for intracranial aneurysms in 3D space with TOF-MRA images. The average and maximum inflow velocity (Vavg-IA, Vmax-IA), blood flow (Flowavg-IA, Flowmax-IA), and average wall shear stress (WSSavg-IA) for aneurysms were assessed from 4D-flow MRI in regions of interest drawn by two neuroradiologists. The aneurysmal wall enhancement (AWE) grades between precontrast and postcontrast T1-VISTA images were evaluated by three neuroradiologists. Statistical tests: Kruskal–Wallis H test, χ2 test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, scatter plots and regression lines, multivariate logistic regression analysis (partial correlation r) were performed. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The WSSavg-IA (0.52 ± 0.34 vs. 0.27 ± 0.22) and AWE grades (1.38 ± 1.04 vs. 2.02 ± 0.68) between the two inflow angle subgroups of side-wall aneurysms were significantly different. The aneurysm size (rs = 0.31), WSSavg-IA (rs = −0.45), and AWE grades (rs = 0.45) were significantly correlated with inflow angle in side-wall aneurysms. While in bifurcation aneurysms, there were no significant associations between inflow angle and size (P = 0.901), Vavg-IA (P = 0.699), Vmax-IA (P = 0.482), Flowavg-IA (P = 0.550), Flowmax-IA (P = 0.689), WSSavg-IA (P = 0.573), and AWE grades (P = 0.872). Data conclusion: A larger aneurysm size, a lower WSS and a higher AWE grade were correlated with a larger inflow angle in side-wall aneurysms. Evidence Level: 3.

The objective of this study was to rapidly identify ICI-IA patients in clinical data and assess associated immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and risk factors. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of the electronic health records (EHRs) of 89 patients who developed ICI-IA out of 2451 cancer patients who received ICI therapy at Northwestern University between March 2011 to January 2021. Logistic regression and random forest machine learning models were trained on all EHR diagnoses, labs, medications, and procedures to identify ICI-IA patients and EHR codes indicating ICI-IA. Multivariate logistic regression was then used to test associations between ICI-IA and cancer type, ICI regimen, and comorbid irAEs. Results: Logistic regression and random forest models identified ICI-IA patients with accuracies of 0.79 and 0.80, respectively. Key EHR features from the random forest model included ICI-IA relevant features (joint pain, steroid prescription, rheumatoid factor tests) and features suggesting comorbid irAEs (thyroid function tests, pruritus, triamcinolone prescription). Compared to 871 adjudicated ICI patients who did not develop arthritis, ICI-IA patients had higher odds of developing cutaneous (odds ratio [OR]=2.66; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.63-4.35), endocrine (OR=2.09; 95% CI 1.15-3.80), or gastrointestinal (OR=2.88; 95% CI 1.76-4.72) irAEs adjusting for demographics, cancer type, and ICI regimen. Melanoma (OR=1.99; 95% CI 1.08-3.65) and renal cell carcinoma (OR=2.03; 95% CI 1.06-3.84) patients were more likely to develop ICI-IA compared to lung cancer patients. Patients on nivolumab+ipilimumab were more likely to develop ICI-IA compared to patients on pembrolizumab (OR=1.86; 95% CI 1.01-3.43). Discussion: Our machine learning models rapidly identified patients with ICI-IA in EHR data and elucidated clinical features indicative of comorbid irAEs. Patients with ICI-IA were significantly more likely to also develop cutaneous, endocrine, and gastrointestinal irAEs during their clinical course compared to ICI therapy patients without ICI-IA.

ICI-induced IA treatment requires balancing immune activation to fight cancer and immune modulation to control autoimmunity. Our objective was to learn how patients experience ICI-induced IA and potentially conflicting treatment decisions. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants with rheumatologist-diagnosed ICI-induced IA recruited from a longitudinal cohort. The interview guide probed the experience of diagnosis and treatment, symptoms and impact of ICI-induced IA, coping mechanisms, and treatment decision-making. Two researchers used an iterative coding process to identify themes through inductive thematic analysis and consensus. An overarching conceptual framework was derived from the qualitative analysis to identify care gaps perceived by patients, and inform future research. Results: Fourteen patients with ICI-induced IA participated in semi-structured interviews. Five overarching themes were identified: An awareness gap leading to delay in diagnosis of IA, descriptors of ICI-induced IA and relationship to other adverse events, emotional and quality-of-life impact of IA, fear and decision-making, and contextual factors including social support. Conclusions: As reported by patients, ICI-induced IA had a significant functional and emotional impact, even as compared to cancer and other ICI-induced side effects. Increasing awareness and integrated care of ICI-induced IA, and increasing social support are key targets for improving patient care. Additionally, more data on cancer outcomes in patients requiring immunomodulation for ICI-induced IA would help address fear and uncertainty for patients, and better support them through therapeutic decisions. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cancer; Immunotherapy; Inflammatory arthritis; Quality of life; Social support","immune checkpoint inhibitor; immunomodulating agent; unclassified drug; adult; adverse outcome; Article; cancer therapy; clinical article; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; consensus; coping behavior; emotion; fear; female; human; longitudinal study; male; medical decision making; middle aged; priority journal; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; quality of life; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatologist; scientist; semi structured interview; social support","","BioMed Central","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089753868"

The present study investigated the neural and socio-psychological mechanisms underlying the association between TA and IA. Methods: Firstly, we tested the correlation between TA and IA. Then we investigated the longitudinal influence of TA on IA using a linear mixed effect (LME) model. Secondly, connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) was employed to explore neuromarkers of TA, and we tested whether the identified neuromarkers of TA can predict IA. Lastly, stressful life events and default mode network (DMN) were considered as mediating variables to explore the relationship between TA and IA. Findings: A significant positive correlation between TA and IA was found and the high TA group demonstrated higher IA across time. CPM results revealed that the functional connectivity of cognitive control and emotion-regulation circuits and DMN were significantly correlated with TA. Furthermore, a significant association was found between the neuromarkers of TA and IA. Notably, the CPM results were all validated in an independent sample. The results of mediation demonstrated that stressful life events and correlated functional connectivity mediated the association between TA and IA. Conclusions: Findings of the present study facilitate a deeper understanding of the neural and socio-psychological mechanisms linking TA and IA and provide new directions for developing neural and psychological interventions.  © 2023 The Author(s).","control circuit; DMN; emotion-regulation circuit; functional connectivity; IA; stressful life events; TA","Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Behavior, Addictive; Emotions; Humans; Internet; Internet Addiction Disorder; Longitudinal Studies; biological marker; neuromarker; unclassified drug; adolescent; Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Check-List; adult; Article; connectome; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross validation; data analysis; default mode network; demographics; emotion regulation; executive function; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; graph theoretical network analysis; human; image analysis; image processing; information processing; internet addiction; life stress; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mediation analysis; network analysis; personality; predictive model; questionnaire; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; stress assessment; trait anxiety; undergraduate student; addiction; anxiety; anxiety disorder; emotion; Internet; psychology","","Akademiai Kiado ZRt.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187687244"

This study aimed to investigate the immune function and its impact on patient outcomes in IA and MIA children. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study included children aged 0–19 years with intestinal atresia who were referred to a multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation program from 1/2000 to 12/2016. Data were collected for patient characteristics, surgical history, immunologic work-up, and infection-related hospitalizations. Groups of IA and MIA children were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and using Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables, as appropriate. Results: Twenty-seven children (18 IA, 9 MIA) were included. More than half of the patients had low CD counts for age in IA and MIA groups: CD3 58.3% vs. 66.7% (p = 1.0), CD4 50.0% vs. 66.7% (p = 0.7), CD8 67.7% vs. 88.9% (p = 0.3), respectively. Six out of 12 IA children and 3 out of 8 MIA children had hypogammaglobulinemia (p = 0.7). Three out of 10 IA patients and 3 out of 5 MIA children had frequent bacteremia (≥ 5/year). Eight children (6 IA and 2 MIA) underwent intestinal and/or liver transplant; MIA children had a worse posttransplant outcome. Conclusions: IA children may have an immunodeficiency and associated infectious complications requiring hospitalization. We suggest performing immunologic evaluation not only in MIA but also in IA children presenting to an intestinal rehabilitation program to identify immunodeficiency. Early immunodeficiency screening may help initiate appropriate intervention and improve patient outcomes.

Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of induction regimens in combination with cytarabine; involving imported or domestic IDA, or daunorubicin (DNR). Methods: The study was conducted from 1st July 2012 to 30th November 2015 at Baoding No.1 Central Hospital. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed AML admitted to Baoding First Central Hospital, China. Patients were divided into three groups according to their treatment regimen: the IA-imported group, the IA-domestic group, and the DNR group. Clinical data, complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), non-remission (NR) rates, and side effects were compared. Results: Total 282 patients were enrolled, including 123 patients in the IA-imported group, 98 in the IA-domestic group and 61 in the DNR group. The IA-domestic and IA-imported groups’ remission rates were similar (P = 0.123) but significantly different from the DNR group (both P < 0.05). Side effects were similar in all three groups and no severe side effects were reported. Conclusion: Cytarabine induction regimens showed similar remission rates in combination with IDA produced in China compared to imported IDA and were more effective than DNR. © 2021, Professional Medical Publications.

Therefore, the study aimed to derive a more detailed estimation of this association between AR and ruptured IA in Chinese IA patients. Methods: The present work was a cross-sectional study. We retrospectively collected 1,588 Chinese patients with a single IA from January 2010 to November 2017. The relationship was examined between AR at diagnosis and ruptured IA. Covariates included data of demographics, morphological parameters, lifestyle habits, clinical features, and comorbidities. Binary logistic regression and two-piecewise linear models were used to analyze independent associations of AR with ruptured IA. Results: The results suggest that the association between AR and IA rupture was U-shaped. In the AR range of 1.08–1.99, the prevalence of IA rupture was 13% lower for each 0.1-unit increment in AR [odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80–0.98]. Conversely, for every 0.1-unit increase in AR, the prevalence of IA rupture increased by ~3% (odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.06) in the AR range of 3.42–4.08. Conclusion: The relationship between AR and ruptured IA was U-shaped, with the negative association at AR of 1.08–1.99 and positive association at AR of 3.42–4.08. © Copyright © 2021 Yin, Su, Zhang, Bi, Duan, Huang and Wang.","aspect ratio (AR); association; generalized additive model; rupture of intracranial aneurysm; subgroup analysis","adult; Article; brain artery aneurysm rupture; Chinese; clinical feature; comorbidity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; disease association; female; human; intracranial aneurysm; lifestyle modification; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; morphology; prevalence; retrospective study","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119399572"

Method: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data from 163 patients with anterior circulation IA diagnosed by head and neck computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patients were categorized into two groups: the ruptured group (57 cases) and the unruptured group (106 cases). CA was categorized based on its location into three segments: the extracranial segment of the internal carotid artery (EICA) TI, the angle of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the common carotid artery (CCA) TI. Measure the morphological parameters of all IA: IA length neck (L), IA height (H), aneurysm diameter width (D), the ratio of L to the mean diameter of the IA-bearing artery (SR), the ratio of H to D (AR), the angle of flow inflow (FA) and IA angle (AA). The study conducted five types of analysis to determine the risk factors for anterior circulation IA rupture. The first was an univariate analysis of the risk factors. The second was an analysis of the correlation between CA TI and IA morphological parameters. The third used multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis to analyse independent risk factors for IA rupture. The fourth was to plot ROC curves to build a predictive model for IA rupture and calculate diagnostic thresholds. Finally, a data set from another hospital (78 cases) was used as a validation set to validate the multivariate model. Result: Univariate analysis revealed that there were statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in gender, EICA TI, location of IA and IA morphological parameters (FA, H, AR, L, SR), which acted as risk factors for anterior circulation IA rupture. The results of Spearman correlation analysis indicate that CCA TI is significantly correlated with SR, H and L (P < 0.05), while EICA TI is significantly correlated with FA and L (P < 0.05). The results of multivariate logistic analysis showed that FA (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.04–1.10, P < 0.001), SR (OR = 4.949, 95%CI = 1.96–12.53, P = 0.001), EICA TI (OR = 1.037, 95%CI = 1.01–1.07, P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for IA rupture. The ROC curve plotting results suggest that the area under the curve (AUC) of FA is 0.860 with a diagnostic threshold of 110.1°; the AUC of SR is 0.786 with a diagnostic threshold of 1.67; the AUC of EICA TI is 0.723 with a diagnostic threshold of 28.845; the AUC of the three combined is 0.903 with a threshold of 0.480. The combined factor diagnostic model is validated according to the validation set, and the results show that the AUC (0.866) of the validation set is not much different from the AUC (0.903) of the multivariate model, and the multivariate model has a better diagnostic effect. Conclusion: In clinical practice, it is important to consider the evaluation of aneurysm rupture in combination with imaging, as FA, SR and ECIA TI are independent risk factors for IA rupture in the anterior circulation. Unlike the IA morphological parameters, EICA TI is an often overlooked extracranial parameter, but is equally important in its power to predict IA rupture. When the EICA TI exceeds 28.845, the IA has the possibility of rupture. Finally, multivariate diagnostic model are of interest when considering rupture of the anterior circulation IA. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Aneurysm rupture; Internal carotid artery; Intracranial aneurysm; Morphological parameters; Tortuosity index","Aneurysm, Ruptured; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery, Internal; Cerebral Angiography; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; adult; aneurysm diameter; aneurysm rupture; Article; brain circulation; cardiovascular parameters; carotid artery tortuosity index; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; female; gender; human; image analysis; internal carotid artery; intracranial aneurysm; major clinical study; male; morphology; neuroimaging; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; univariate analysis; validation process; aneurysm rupture; brain angiography; carotid artery; complication; diagnostic imaging; intracranial aneurysm; procedures; risk factor","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172213808"

This study aimed to determine if IA HA utilization and payer coverage of viscosupplementation affected the prevalence of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures and the age of TKA patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis from 2014 to 2020 using a large national commercial claims data set. We analyzed the number of TKA procedures and the age of the patients in states that covered IA HA vs those with limited coverage. Mixed random effects and slopes models were used to identify the impact of the IA HA injections. Results: Of 7,335,301 patients with knee OA, 440,606 (6.0%) received a TKA procedure at an average age of 59 years. The rate of TKA procedures increased by 0.56% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.66; P <.001). Payer coverage of IA HA injections had no effect on TKA prevalence (P =.926). The age of surgical patients increased yearly by 0.15 years (95% CI 0.12-0.18; P <.001), regardless of IA HA injections (P =.990). After controlling for demographics and comorbidities, patients that received an IA HA injection had a higher probability of receiving a subsequent TKA (odds ratio = 2.83; 95% CI 2.80-2.87; P <.001); this finding was conditional of patients' age at the first diagnosis of knee OA. Conclusions: Additional clinical trials should be employed to identify the role of HA injections in the treatment armamentarium for knee OA. © 2022 The Authors","Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections; Knee osteoarthritis; Total knee arthroplasty","hyaluronic acid; adult; Article; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; Current Procedural Terminology; demographics; drug effect; Elixhauser comorbidity index; female; follow up; health insurance; human; ICD-10; ICD-9; knee osteoarthritis; knee pain; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prevalence; retrospective study; surgical patient; total knee arthroplasty; viscosupplementation","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145230737"

The histology of such interval appendicitis (IA) has only been described in small series. Also, we have noticed a recent increase in the incidence of IA specimens at our institution. Methods and results: We identified appendectomy specimens in our department during 2018 with available haematoxylin and eosin slides and electronic clinical data, and evaluated multiple histological findings. Cases were then divided into AA and IA, based on clinical history (AA if the patient presented to the hospital within 1 week of symptom onset and underwent appendectomy within 48 h; IA if appendectomy was delayed at least 1 week). Changes between groups were compared. The cohort included 165 cases (125 AA, 40 IA). Findings significantly more common in AA included mucosal acute inflammation, mural acute inflammation and acute serositis. Findings significantly more common in IA included Crohn-like mural inflammation, mural fibrosis, goblet cell hyperplasia, granulomas, xanthogranulomatous inflammation, haemosiderin-laden macrophages and granulation tissue. The rate of IA in 2018 (24%) was noticeably higher than in previous years. Conclusion: Acute inflammatory changes are more common in AA but can remain present in IA. Mural fibrosis, serosal adhesions, haemosiderin-laden macrophages and granulation tissue suggest IA. Granulomas and xanthogranulomatous inflammation can also be seen in IA, and Crohn-like mural inflammation is not uncommon. These histological patterns can guide signout and prevent diagnostic errors, particularly when clinical information is unavailable. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","appendicitis; appendix; granulomatous appendicitis; interval appendicitis","Acute Disease; Appendicitis; Crohn Disease; Fibrosis; Granuloma; Hemosiderin; Humans; Inflammation; Retrospective Studies; eosin; hematoxylin; hemosiderin; acute appendicitis; acute disease; adult; aged; appendectomy; appendicitis; Article; chronic disease; chronic inflammation; cohort analysis; Crohn disease; female; fibrosis; goblet cell; granulation tissue; granuloma; granulomatosis; hemosiderin laden macrophage; histopathology; human; hyperplasia; incidence; inflammation; interval appendicitis; major clinical study; male; medical history; mucosal acute inflammation; mural acute inflammation; mural fibrosis; retrospective study; serositis; appendicitis; Crohn disease; pathology","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127438814"

We aimed to investigate physician-perceived benefits and drawbacks of offering IA injections. Methods: We conducted individual interviews with orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists, and physiatrists who treat patients with knee OA. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify factors that physicians weigh when making IA injection recommendations. Results: We interviewed 18 physicians from academic and community practices. We identified the following 4 categories of themes that influenced providers' recommendations to their patients regarding injections: 1) the physician's knowledge, beliefs, and concerns, including their propensity to rely on guidelines versus clinical experience, and understanding of the efficacy and risks associated with injectables, such as possible cartilage damage; 2) the characteristics of the injectable product, such as ease or number of administrations needed; 3) the individual patient-specific factors, including OA severity, comorbidities, and patient preference for and expectations of specific IA injections; and 4) the financial and administrative factors, including insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs. Conclusion: Physicians factor the uncertain efficacy of injectable treatments and the need to manage patient expectations into their decision to offer IA therapies. Some providers relied on evidence and guidelines while others were swayed more by clinical experience. High out-of-pocket costs were seen as a barrier to use. These findings may help in the delivery of IA injections for OA and in the development of injectable products. © 2020 American College of Rheumatology.","","Humans; Injections, Intra-Articular; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patient Preference; Physicians; Qualitative Research; administrative health data; Article; comorbidity; cost; disease severity; financial management; health belief; health insurance; human; intraarticular drug administration; knee osteoarthritis; orthopedic surgeon; patient preference; physiatrist; physician attitude; practice guideline; protocol compliance; qualitative research; rheumatologist; risk; thematic analysis; treatment outcome; intraarticular drug administration; knee osteoarthritis; physician","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126857276"

Reports of safety and efficacy of this approach are limited by technical heterogeneity and sample size. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a data set of patients undergoing ET for LVO between August 2017 and September 2020 to identify those that received IA tPA. IA tPA usage, timing and dosage was at the discretion of the operative neurosurgeon. We identified three broad categories of IA tPA administration: (1) adjunctive with the first pass; (2) salvage with subsequent passes after first pass achieved incomplete revascularization; and (3) post-thrombectomy residual distal occlusions. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to test associations with recanalization, hemorrhage, and functional independence. Results: Among 271 patients, 158 (58%) patients had IA tPA, of which 83 received adjuvant IA tPA, 60 received salvage IA tPA, and 15 received post-thrombectomy IA tPA for distal occlusions. There were no differences in demographics, stroke etiology and premorbid medications between these groups. Patients receiving salvage IA tPA had longer times from groin access to recanalization and more passes, as expected. On multivariate analysis neither adjunctive nor salvage IA tPA was significantly associated with recanalization, post-operative hemorrhage, or functional outcomes. On univariate analysis, patients receiving salvage IA tPA had lower rates of TICI 3 or 2b revascularization (80% vs. 89% adjunctive and 92% no IA tPA, p = 0.003) and higher rates of any postoperative hemorrhage (33% vs. 22% adjunctive and 19% no IA tPA, p = 0.003). Conclusions: In this retrospective, single-institution series, IA tPA used adjunctively or as salvage therapy in ET for LVO was not associated with recanalization, post-operative hemorrhage, or functional outcomes, suggesting IA tPA is an available modality that can be utilized in cases of recalcitrant clots. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Endovascular; Intra-arterial; Stroke; Thrombectomy; tPA","Brain Ischemia; Embolectomy; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Stroke; Thrombectomy; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Treatment Outcome; fibrinolytic agent; tissue plasminogen activator; adverse event; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic imaging; embolectomy; human; retrospective study; thrombectomy; treatment outcome","","W.B.

However, the prevalence of IA and its relationship with clinical variables among Chinese adolescents with schizophrenia is unclear. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of IA and its clinical correlates in Chinese adolescents with schizophrenia, which has not yet been reported. Methods: Seven hundred and six inpatient adolescents with schizophrenia were recruited. All patients underwent Young’s Internet Addiction Test (IAT) to measure Internet addiction, as well as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for psychopathology. Results: Our results showed that 186 patients had a total IAT score of 50 or more, bringing the prevalence of IA to 26.3%. Girls (21.7%, 92/424) were less likely to have combined IA than boys (33.3%, 94/282). Compared to those patients without IA, patients with IA had better socioeconomic status, higher probability of living in the city, higher levels of depressive symptoms, excited symptoms, and lower levels of concrete symptoms and PANSS total scores (all p<0.05). Further binary logistic regression analysis indicated that good socioeconomic status, living in the city and PANSS total scores were significantly associated with IA. In addition, correlation analysis showed significant correlations between IA total score and the following parameters: good socioeconomic status, living in the city, negative subscore, concrete subscore, depression subscore, excited subscore and PANSS total score (Bonferroni corrected all p <0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the prevalence of IA in Chinese adolescents with schizophrenia is higher than that in the general population. Several demographic and clinical variables are risk factors for IA in adolescents with schizophrenia.

However, the cell architecture and inflammation in the IA dome remain less understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on ruptured and unruptured human IA domes for delineating the cell atlas, gene expression perturbations, and inflammation features. Two external bulk mRNA sequencing–based data sets and serological results of 126 patients were collected for validation. As a result, a total of 21 332 qualified cells were captured. Vascular cells, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes, were assigned in extremely sparse numbers (4.84%), and were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Pericytes, characterized by ABCC9 and HIGD1B, were identified in the IA dome for the first time. Abundant immune cells were identified, with the proportion of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils being remarkably higher in ruptured IA. The lymphocyte compartment was also thoroughly categorized. By leveraging external data sets and machine learning algorithms, macrophages were robustly associated with IA rupture, irrespective of their polarization status. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs2280543, which is identified in East Asian populations, was associated with macrophage metabolic reprogramming through regulating TALDO1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the cellular architecture and inflammatory features in the IA dome and may enlighten novel therapeutics for unruptured IA. © 2024 The Authors.

Methods: GSE122897 and GSE13353 datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. Data extracted from GSE122897 were used for analyzing differential gene expression, and consensus clustering was performed to identify stable molecular subtypes. Clinical characteristics were compared between subgroups, and fast gene set enrichment analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis were performed. Hub genes were identified via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. Predictive models were constructed based on hub genes using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and logistic regression algorithm. Immune cell infiltration in IA samples was analyzed using Microenvironment Cell Population counter, CIBERSORT, and xCell algorithm. The correlation between hub genes and immune cells was analyzed. The predictive model and immune cell infiltration were validated using data from the GSE13353 dataset. Results: A total of 43 IA samples were classified into 2 subgroups based on gene expression profiles. Subgroup I had a higher risk of rupture, while 70% of subgroup II remained unruptured. In subgroup I, specific genes were associated with inflammation and immunity, and weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed that the black module genes were linked to IA rupture. We identified 4 hub genes (spermine synthase, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, zymogen granule protein 16B, and LIM and calponin-homology domains 1), which constructed predictive models with good diagnostic performance in differentiating between ruptured and unruptured IA samples. Monocytic lineage was found to be a significant factor in IA rupture, and the 4 hub genes were linked to monocytic lineage (P < 0.05). Conclusions: We reveal a new molecular subtype that can reflect the actual pathological state of IA rupture, and our predictive models constructed by machine learning algorithms can efficiently predict IA rupture. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Immune processes; Inflammation; Intracranial aneurysms rupture; Machine learning; Molecular subtype","Aneurysm, Ruptured; Humans; Inflammation; Intracranial Aneurysm; Machine Learning; Transcriptome; calponin; cytokine receptor; interleukin 12; interleukin 4; interleukin 8; LIM and calponin homology domains 1; macrophage receptor with collagenous structure; receptor; spermine synthase; transcriptome; unclassified drug; zymogen granule; zymogen granule protein 16B; transcriptome; algorithm; Article; B lymphocyte activation; brain artery aneurysm rupture; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell infiltration; cell lineage; cell organelle; cell population; cell proliferation; chromosome segregation; CIBERSORT algorithm; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxic lymphocyte; dendritic cell; differential gene expression; eosinophil; extreme gradient boosting; functional enrichment analysis; gamma delta T lymphocyte; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene ontology; gene set enrichment analysis; human; immune signaling; immunocompetent cell; immunoregulation; intracranial aneurysm; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; leukocyte adherence; light gradient boosting machine; logistic regression analysis; lymphocyte proliferation; M1 macrophage; M2 macrophage; machine learning; mast cell; microenvironment cell population counter; molecular biology; monocyte; mononuclear cell; myeloid dendritic cell; natural killer cell; nervous system inflammation; neutrophil; nuclear division; predictive model; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; regulatory mechanism; T lymphocyte activation; transcriptomics; unruptured intracranial aneurysm; upregulation; weighted gene co expression network analysis; xCell algorithm; aneurysm rupture; inflammation; machine learning; pathology","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171345960"

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with IA among middle school students of Hunan Province, China. Relevance between IA and childhood trauma was also explored. Methods: One thousand six hundred ten students were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Data collected included demographics; internet addiction (revised-Chen internet addiction scale); childhood trauma (CTQ-SF); depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (DASS-21); suicidal behaviors, as well as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Cramer’s V analysis, univariable logistic regression and multivariable logistic regression were used for associations and identifying independent relevance of IA, respectively. Results: The prevalence of IA was 12.8%. Cramer’s V analysis showed that IA was associated with emotional abuse, emotional and physical neglect, NSSI, suicidal behaviors, stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, physical disorder history. Regression analysis showed that IA was independently associated with emotional neglect (OR = 3.062, 95% CI: 2.083, 4.501, p < 0.001); physical neglect (OR = 2.328; 95% CI: 1.590, 3.409, p < 0.001); depressive symptoms (OR = 2.218, 95% CI: 1.467, 3.353, p < 0.001) nationality (OR = 1.888, 95% CI: 1.034, 3.447, p = 0.006) and age (OR = 1.253, 95% CI: 1.066, 1.471, p = 0.006). Discussion: IA is common among middle school students. Attention should be paid to students with childhood trauma since they have a higher risk for IA, which may increase the risk for suicidal behaviors.

Thus, this study was performed to examine whether hyperglycemia control status is independently associated with single IA rupture in patients with DM. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on two Chinese hospitals between January 2010 and November 2017. Medical records of 223 patients with single IA and DM were reviewed and analyzed. We used glycosylated hemoglobin (GHB) as the independent variable of interest, and the outcome variable was ruptured status of IA. Covariates included data on demographics, morphological parameters, lifestyle habits, clinical features, and comorbidities. Results: Multivariable adjusted binary logistic regression and sensitivity analyses indicated that GHB was not associated with IA rupture (odds ratio OR, = 1.07, 95% CI 0.84–1.35). A nonlinear association between GHB and IA rupture was observed, whose inflection points were 5.5 and 8.9. The OR values (95% confidence intervals) were 0.38 (0.16–0.9) at the range of 1.88–5.5% of GHB, 1.6 (1.03, 2.5) at the range of 5.5–8.9%, and 0.56 (0.06–5.34) at the range of 8.9–10.1, respectively. Conclusion: The independent correlation between GHB and risk of IA rupture presented is nonlinear. The good glycemic control in single IA patients with DM can reduce the risk of IA rupture, and vice versa.

As such, this study aims to probe into the impact of IA on TFP in the construction industry, so as to provide new insights into the industry development and improvement of TFP in the construction industry. Based on the competing results of the agglomeration effect and congestion effect caused by IA, this study proposed three hypotheses on the impact mechanism of IA on TFP in the construction industry. Then, the non-linear regression model and linear regression model were developed to test the hypotheses based on the provincial panel data from 2002 to 2017 in China. The empirical results reveal that IA has a positive linear impact on TFP in the construction industry, and the impact of IA on TFP in the Chinese construction industry during the observed period is in the embryonic stage. Besides, both the firm scale and economic development level have positive impacts on TFP, whereas the specialization structure has a negative impact. Hence, the government can encourage industrial agglomeration in the construction industry to enhance TFP, in order to leverage the knowledge spillovers, labor pool, and other benefits from IA. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Industrial agglomeration; linear regression model; non-linear regression model; the construction industry; total factor productivity","China; Agglomeration; Knowledge management; Linear regression; Agglomeration effects; Impact mechanism; Industrial agglomeration; Industry development; Linear regression modelling; Non-linear regression; Non-linear regression model; The construction industry; Total factor productivity; agglomeration; construction industry; industrial development; numerical model; regression analysis; total factor productivity; Construction industry","","Routledge","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144251559"

We studied 67 children: 42 who developed IA (20 of 42 progressed to diabetes) and 25 control subjects matched for sex and age. Biomarkers were assessed at four time points: Earliest available sample, just prior to IA, just after IA, and just prior to diabetes onset. Predictors of IA and progression to diabetes were identified across disparate sources using an integrative machine learning algorithm and optimization-based feature selection. Our integrative approach was predictive of IA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.91) and progression to diabetes (AUC 0.92) based on standard cross-validation (CV). Among the strongest predictors of IA were change in serum ascorbate, 3-methyl-oxobutyrate, and the PTPN22 (rs2476601) polymorphism. Serum glucose, ADP fibrinogen, and mannose were among the strongest predictors of progression to diabetes. This proof-of-principle analysis is the first study to integrate large, diverse biomarker data sets into a limited number of features, highlighting differences in pathways leading to IA from those predicting progression to diabetes. Integratedmodels, if validated in independent populations, could provide novel clues concerning the pathways leading to IA and type 1 diabetes. © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adenosine Diphosphate; Adolescent; Ascorbic Acid; Autoimmunity; Biomarkers; Butyrates; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Fibrinogen; Humans; Infant; Male; Mannose; Models, Biological; Polymorphism, Genetic; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22; Young Adult; 3 methyl oxobutyrate; adenosine diphosphate; ascorbic acid; biological marker; fibrinogen; glucose; mannose; oxoacid; unclassified drug; adenosine diphosphate; ascorbic acid; biological marker; butyric acid derivative; fibrinogen; mannose; non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 22; PTPN22 protein, human; adolescent; adult; area under the curve; Article; autoimmunity; case control study; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; feature selection; female; genotype; glucose blood level; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; machine learning; male; metabolomics; outcome assessment; pancreas islet autoimmunity; priority journal; proteomics; receiver operating characteristic; autoimmunity; biological model; blood; genetic polymorphism; genetics; immunology; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; preschool child; young adult","","American Diabetes Association Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078380011"

Methods: We performed a retrospective study of clinicopathologic data from 654 patients with stage IA lung adenocarcinoma collected between 2013 and 2019. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of these components, and we also evaluated the relationship between markers of inflammation and recurrence. Results: Micropapillary-positive participants had high preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios. There were no significant differences in the levels of markers of systemic inflammation between the participants with or without a solid component. Multivariate analysis showed that preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 2.094; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.668–2.628), tumor size (OR = 1.386; 95% CI, 1.044–1.842), and carcinoembryonic antigen concentration (OR = 1.067; 95% CI, 1.017–1.119) were independent predictors of a micropapillary component. There were no significant correlations between markers of systemic inflammation and the recurrence of stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusions: Preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio independently predicts a micropapillary component of stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the potential use of preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the optimization of surgical strategies for the treatment of stage IA lung adenocarcinoma should be further studied. © The Author(s) 2024.","carcinoembryonic antigen; cumulative incidence of recurrence; micropapillary component; Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; solid component; stage IA lung adenocarcinoma; tumor size","Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphocyte Count; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Neutrophils; Preoperative Period; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; carcinoembryonic antigen; tumor marker; adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; correlation analysis; female; follow up; histology; histopathology; human; human tissue; inflammation; lung adenocarcinoma; lymphocyte; lymphocyte monocyte ratio; major clinical study; male; middle aged; monocyte; neutrophil; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; people by smoking status; platelet count; platelet lymphocyte ratio; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; tumor volume; aged; blood; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; lymphocyte; lymphocyte count; neutrophil; pathology; preoperative period; prognosis; tumor recurrence","","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191507982"

We used questionnaire data from the Agricultural Health Study (N = 89,655), a cohort of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses in Iowa (IA) and North Carolina (NC), to ascertain drinking water source at enrollment (1993-1997). For users of public water supplies (PWS), we linked participants' geocoded addresses to contaminant monitoring data [five haloacetic acids (HAA5), total trihalomethanes (TTHM), and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N)]. We estimated private well nitrate levels using random forest models accounting for well depth, soil characteristics, nitrogen inputs, and other predictors. We assigned drinking water source for 84% (N = 74,919) of participants. Among these, 69% of IA and 75% of NC participants used private wells; 27% in IA and 21% in NC used PWS. Median PWS nitrate concentrations (NO3-N) were higher in IA [0.9 mg/L, interquartile range (IQR): 0.4-3.1 mg/L] than NC (0.1 mg/L, IQR: 0.1-0.2 mg/L), while median HAA5 and TTHM concentrations were higher in NC (HAA5: 11.9 µg/L, IQR: 5.5-33.4 µg/L; TTHM: 37.7 µg/L, IQR: 10.7-54.7 µg/L) than IA (HAA5: 5.0 µg/L, IQR: 3.7-10.7 µg/L; TTHM: 13.0 µg/L, IQR: 4.2-32.4 µg/L). Private well nitrate concentrations in IA (1.5 mg/L, IQR: 0.8-4.9 mg/L) and NC (1.9 mg/L, IQR: 1.4-2.5 mg/L) were higher than PWS. More private wells in IA (12%) exceeded 10 mg/L NO3-N (regulatory limit for PWS) than NC (<1%). Due to the proximity of their drinking water sources to farms, agricultural communities may be exposed to elevated nitrate levels. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health.

We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of anti-RA33 antibodies in patients with ICI-induced IA. Methods Anti-RA33 ELISAs were performed on sera from four groups of patients: 79 with ICI-induced IA, 52 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 35 treated with ICIs without IA during follow-up and 50 healthy controls. Anti-RA33 positivity and level, clinical and demographic data were compared across groups. Results Anti-RA33 antibodies were found in 9/79 (11.4%) patients with ICI-induced IA but in 0/35 patients treated with ICIs who did not develop IA (0%; p=0.04). Of the patients positive for anti-RA33, two had sera available from before ICI treatment; anti-RA33 antibodies were present in both pre-ICI treatments. In patients with RA, 7.7% were positive for anti-RA33 antibodies as were 2% of healthy controls. In ICI-induced IA, anti-RA33 antibodies were associated with anti-CCP antibodies (p=0.001). We found no statistically significant differences in other clinical characteristics in those with and without anti-RA33 antibodies. Conclusions Anti-RA33 antibodies are present in a subset of patients with ICI-induced IA, absent in other ICI-treated patients and may be a biomarker for developing IA. Additional studies evaluating serial samples before and after ICI treatment will further establish the temporal relationship of these antibodies to IA development. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

When cornstarch was first described as a treatment, few people survived beyond early childhood. As the prognosis for this population has improved, the need to ensure appropriate cornstarch dosing for different age groups has become imperative. Records from 115 patients (10-62 years of age) with GSD Ia evaluated at our center between 2015 and 2017 were reviewed. Data collected included weight, age, genetic mutation, amount and frequency of cornstarch doses, body mass index, gender, 24-hour glucose and lactate concentrations, and biochemical markers of metabolic control. The data demonstrate that adult treatment needs vary greatly from younger age groups, and the required cornstarch support decreases with age (P <.001). The required number of doses, however, did not change with a mean of six doses (range 4-8) daily in all age groups. General laboratory findings across time demonstrate that significantly reducing the amount of starch required to maintain euglycemia with aging can be done without sacrificing metabolic control. Carbohydrate requirements decrease with aging, and older patients were found to require less cornstarch. Failure to lower the cornstarch doses contributes to over-treatment in adults with GSD Ia. Not only does this lead to worsening hepatomegaly and excessive weight gain, but over-treatment contributes to relative hyperinsulinism and rebound hypoglycemia. This knowledge is essential in designing nutritional therapies for the aging GSD population. © 2019 SSIEM","adults; cornstarch; glycogen storage disease type Ia; treatment","Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Child; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease Type I; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Starch; United States; Young Adult; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; glucose; lactic acid; starch; triacylglycerol; uric acid; biological marker; starch; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aging; Article; biochemical analysis; body mass; body weight; body weight gain; child; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; diet therapy; drug dose regimen; female; gene mutation; glycogen storage disease type 1; glycogen storage disease type 1a; glycogen storage disease type 1a; hepatomegaly; human; hyperinsulinism; hypoglycemia; major clinical study; male; metabolic regulation; middle aged; retrospective study; school child; sex difference; young adult; blood; clinical trial; glucose blood level; glycogen storage disease type 1; hypoglycemia; metabolism; multicenter study; statistical model; United States","","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071737253"

To elucidate this, we endeavored to estimate the actual turnover rates of the main molecular constituent in human IA (collagen) on the basis of radiocarbon (14C) birth dating in relation to IA hemodynamics. Methods - Collagen turnover rates in excised human IA samples were calculated using mathematical modeling of 14C birth dating data of collagen in relation to risk factors and histological markers for collagen maturity/turnover in selected IA. Hemodynamics were simulated using image-based computational fluid dynamics. Correlation, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed. Results - Collagen turnover rates were estimated in 46 IA (43 patients); computational fluid dynamics could be performed in 20 IA (20 patients). The mean collagen turnover rate (γ) constituted 126% (±1% error) per year. For patients with arterial hypertension, γ was greater than 2600% annually, whereas γ was distinctly lower with 32% (±1% error) per year for patients without risk factors, such as smoking and hypertension. There was a distinct association between histological presence of rather immature collagen in human IA and the presence of modifiable risk factors. Spatial-temporal averaged wall shear stress predicted rapid collagen turnover (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.7]). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a good test accuracy (area under the curve, 0.798 [95% CI, 0.598-0.998]) for average wall shear stress with a threshold ≥4.9 Pa for rapid collagen turnover. Conclusions - Our data indicate that turnover rates and stability of collagen in human IA are strongly associated with the presence of modifiable risk factors and aneurysmal hemodynamics. These findings underline the importance of strict risk factor modification in patients with unruptured IA. Future should include more detailed risk factor data to establish a more causal understanding of hemodynamics and the rupture risk of individual IA. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Identifying IAs at risk of rupture has important clinical and socio-economic consequences. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of patient and IA characteristics on the likelihood of IA being diagnosed incidentally versus ruptured. Patients were recruited at 21 international centers. Seven phenotypic patient characteristics and three IA characteristics were recorded. The analyzed cohort included 7992 patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that: (1) IA location is the strongest factor associated with IA rupture status at diagnosis; (2) Risk factor awareness (hypertension, smoking) increases the likelihood of being diagnosed with unruptured IA; (3) Patients with ruptured IAs in high-risk locations tend to be older, and their IAs are smaller; (4) Smokers with ruptured IAs tend to be younger, and their IAs are larger; (5) Female patients with ruptured IAs tend to be older, and their IAs are smaller; (6) IA size and age at rupture correlate. The assessment of associations regarding patient and IA characteristics with IA rupture allows us to refine IA disease models and provide data to develop risk instruments for clinicians to support personalized decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.","hypertension; intracranial aneurysm; location; risk factors; smoking; subarachnoid hemorrhage","adult; aneurysm size; Article; awareness; classifier; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; decision making; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; hypertension; intracranial aneurysm; major clinical study; male; middle aged; phenotype; prevalence; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; subarachnoid hemorrhage; unruptured intracranial aneurysm","","MDPI","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138705140"

We employed Analysis of the whole-GEnome (AGE) to address the challenges of closely related species within the genus Aspergillus and developed a rapid detection method. First, reliable whole genome data for 77 Aspergillus species were downloaded from the database, and through bioinformatic analysis, specific targets for each species were identified. Subsequently, sequencing was employed to validate these specific targets. Additionally, we developed an on-site detection method targeting a specific target using a genome editing system. Our results indicate that AGE has successfully achieved reliable identification of all IA-related species (Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus terreus) and three well-known species (A. flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus oryzae) within the Aspergillus section. Flavi and AGE have provided species-level-specific targets for 77 species within the genus Aspergillus. Based on these reference targets, the sequencing results targeting specific targets substantiate the efficacy of distinguishing the focal species from its closely related species. Notably, the amalgamation of room-temperature amplification and genome editing techniques demonstrates the capacity for rapid and accurate identification of genomic DNA samples at a concentration as low as 0.1 ng/μl within a concise 30-min timeframe. Importantly, this methodology circumvents the reliance on large specialized instrumentation by presenting a singular tube operational modality and allowing for visualized result assessment. These advancements aptly meet the exigencies of on-site detection requirements for the specified species, facilitating prompt diagnosis and food quality monitoring. Moreover, as an identification method based on species-specific genomic sequences, AGE shows promising potential as an effective tool for epidemiological research and species classification.

Purpose: To construct an efficient radiomics signature for survival risk stratification personalized for patients with clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid NSCLC. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, six radiomics signatures were constructed for patients with stage IA pure-solid NSCLC who underwent resection between January 2011 and December 2013 at authors' institution and were tested in the radiogenomics data set. The radiomics features were extracted from the intratumoral two-dimensional region, three-dimensional volume, and peritumoral area using PyRadiomics. The discriminative abilities of the signatures were quantified using the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the optimal signature was selected for patient stratification. Results: The study included 592 patients with stage IA pure-solid NSCLC (median age, 61 years; interquartile range, 55-66 years; 269 women) for radiomics analysis: 381 patients for training, 163 for internal validation, and 48 for external validation. The radiomics signature combining three-region features yielded the highest 3- and 5-year AUCs of 0.77 and 0.78, respectively, in the internal validation set and 0.76 and 0.75 , respectively, in the external validation set. Multivariable analysis suggested that the radiomics signature remained an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 6.2; 95% CI: 3.5, 11.0; P , .001) and improved the discriminative ability and clinical usefulness of conventional clinical predictors. Conclusion: The radiomics signature with multiregional features helped stratify the survival risk of patients with clinical stage and pathologic stage IA pure-solid non-small cell lung cancer. © 2022 Radiological Society of North America Inc..

The aim of this study is to determine the best machine learning algorithm for radiomics modeling and to compare the performances of the radiomics model, the clinical-radilogical model and the combined model incorporate both radiomics features and clinical-radilogical features in preoperatively predicting ONM in clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients. Methods: Patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma undergoing curative surgery from one institution were retrospectively recruited and assigned to training and test cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from the preoperative computed tomography (CT) images of the primary tumor. Seven machine learning algorithms were used to construct radiomics models, and the model with the best performance, evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), was selected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed on the clinical-radiological features to identify statistically significant features and to develop a clinical model. The optimal radiomics and clinical models were integrated to build a combined model, and its predictive performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: This study included 258 patients who underwent resection (training cohort, n=182; test cohort, n=76). Six radiomics features were identified. Among the seven machine learning algorithms, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest performance for radiomics modeling, with an AUC of 0.917. The combined model improved the AUC to 0.933 and achieved a Brier score of 0.092. DCA revealed that the combined model had optimal clinical efficacy. Conclusions: The superior performance of the combined model, based on XGB algorithm in predicting ONM in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma, might aid surgeons in deciding whether to conduct mediastinal LN dissection and contribute to improve patients’ prognosis. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

The immune mechanism of IA is more complicated, and it is unclear so far. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore the immune related molecular mechanism of IA. Methods: All data were downloaded from the public database. Limma package and ssGSEA algorithm was used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and analyze immune cell infiltration, respectively. Machine learning and cytoscape-cytohubba plug-in was used to identify key immune types and multicentric DEmRNAs of IA, respectively. Multicentric DEmRNAs related to key immune cells were screened out as key DEmRNAs by Spearman correlation analysis. Diagnostic models, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network and transcription factor regulatory network were constructed based on key DEmRNAs. Meanwhile, drugs related to key DEmRNAs were screened out based on DGIdb database. The expression of key DEmRNAs was also verified by real time-PCR. Results: In this study, 7 key DEmRNAs (NRXN1, GRIA2, SLC1A2, SLC17A7, IL6, VEGFA and SYP) associated with key differential immune cell infiltration (CD56bright natural killer cell, Immature B cell and Type 1 T helper cell) were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that VEGFA and IL6 may be involved in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, IL6 was also found to be enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway. In the ceRNA regulatory network, a large number of miRNAs and lncRNAs were found. In the transcription factor regulatory network, the transcription factor SP1 was correlated with VEGFA, SYP and IL6. It is also predicted that drugs related to key DEmRNAs such as CARBOPLATIN, FENTANYL and CILOSTAZOL may contribute to the treatment of IA. In addition, it was also found that SVM and RF models based on key DEmRNAs may be potential markers for diagnosing IA and unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA), respectively. The expression trend of key DEmRNAs verified by real-time PCR was consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results.

Method: Patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital between January 2015 and October 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All surgically resected nodules were pathologically classified into less-invasive and invasive cohorts. Each nodule was manually segmented, and its computerized texture features were extracted. Clinicopathological and computed tomographic texture features were compared between 2 cohorts. A nomogram for distinguishing the pathological invasiveness was established and validated. Results: Among 428 enrolled patients, 249 were diagnosed with invasive pathological subtypes. Smoking status (odds ratio, 2.906; 95% confidence interval, 1.285-6.579; P = .011), mean computed tomography attenuation value (odds ratio, 1.005, 95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.007; P < .001), and entropy (odds ratio, 8.536, 95% confidence interval, 3.478-20.951; P < .001) were identified as independent predictors for pathological invasiveness by multivariate logistics regression analysis. The nomogram showed good calibration (P = .182) with an area under the curve of 0.849 when validated with testing set data. Decision curve analysis indicated the potentially clinical usefulness of the model with respect to treat-all or treat-none scenario. Compared with intraoperative frozen-section, the nomogram performed better in pathological invasiveness diagnosis (area under the curve, 0.815 vs 0.670; P = .00095). Conclusions: We established and validated a nomogram to compute the probability of invasiveness of clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma with great calibration, which may contribute to decisions related to resection extent. © 2020 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery","computed tomography; lung adenocarcinoma; nomogram; sublobar resection; texture feature","Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Adult; Aged; Clinical Decision-Making; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Pulmonary Nodules; Neoplasm Staging; Nomograms; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Solitary Pulmonary Nodule; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; adult; Article; calibration; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; female; frozen section; histopathology; human; human tissue; intraoperative period; lung adenocarcinoma; lung lobectomy; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nomogram; overall survival; people by smoking status; quantitative analysis; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; segmentectomy; survival analysis; three-dimensional imaging; tumor invasion; validation process; wedge resection; aged; cancer staging; clinical decision making; computer assisted diagnosis; decision support system; diagnostic imaging; lung adenocarcinoma; lung nodule; lung tumor; multiple pulmonary nodules; nomogram; pathology; predictive value; reproducibility; risk assessment; risk factor; x-ray computed tomography","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100244301"

Each CCD camera captures part of the tooth from a different angle. The images captured by different cameras must be registered to construct the relational 3D model. Sample consensus initial alignment (SAC-IA) algorithm is usually adopted, and fast point feature histograms (FPFH) descriptor is selected to calculate eigenvalues for different images. However, the original SAC-IA algorithm cannot satisfy a real-time application because of low efficiency and accuracy. According to the application of voxel nearest neighbor search in octree in 3D data search, this paper proposes an improved SAC-IA algorithm based on voxel nearest neighbor search to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. The experimental results show that comparing to the traditional SAC-IA algorithm, the proposed algorithm based on voxel nearest neighbor search improves the efficiency by 20.95% and the registration accuracy by 24.95%. The improved algorithm can be deployed to construct a 3D model of a tooth as well as 3D model construction of other objects based on coded structured light. © 2022 by Begell House, Inc.","fast point feature histograms descriptor; impression; octree; point cloud registration; sample consensus initial alignment algorithm; voxel nearest neighbor search","Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Consensus; Humans; 3D modeling; CCD cameras; Efficiency; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Graphic methods; Image classification; Iterative methods; Three dimensional computer graphics; Alignment algorithms; Descriptors; Fast point feature histogram descriptor; Impression; Initial alignment; Near neighbor searches; Octrees; Point cloud registration; Point features; Sample consensus; Sample consensus initial alignment algorithm; Voxel near neighbor search; algorithm; article; consensus; controlled study; histogram; tooth; cluster analysis; consensus; human; Nearest neighbor search","","Begell House Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136185794"

There are limited data on the prevalence and rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) in the setting of LDS, with no established guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence and rupture risk of IA in LDS. METHODS: Electronic medical records of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LDS and available cerebrovascular imaging were reviewed. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of IA. Unmatched and propensity-matched analyses were used to identify potential risk factors for aneurysm formation. RESULTS: Records of 1111 patients were screened yielding a total of 60 patients with a diagnosis of LDS. Eighteen (30%) patients had IA, 4 (22.2%) of whom had multiple aneurysms for a total of 24 IAs. Twenty-three (95.8%) aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation; none of them were ruptured. On unmatched analysis, age (P =.015), smoking history (P =.034), hypertension (P =.035), and number of extracranial aneurysms (P <.001) were significantly higher in patients with IA. After matching for age, sex, race, stroke history, family history, and extracranial aneurysms, smoking history (P =.009) remained significant. CONCLUSION: Patients with LDS have an increased risk of IAs, especially with a history of smoking. The prevalence rate of IAs in our series was 30%. Screening imaging should be considered at diagnosis, and patients should be encouraged to abstain from smoking. Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of IA rupture and treatment considerations in this unique population.  © 2022 Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

Method: The data of stage IA elderly NSCLC patients (≥ 70 years) with tumors less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter were extracted. Propensity-matched analysis was used. Lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) was compared among the patients after lobectomy and sub-lobar resection. The proportional hazards model was applied to identify multiple prognostic factors. Results: A total of 3,504 patients met criteria after propensity score matching (PSM). Although the LCSS was better for lobectomy than for sub-lobar resection in patients with tumors ≤ 3 cm before PSM (p < 0.001), no significant difference in the LCSS was identified between the two treatment groups after PSM (p = 0.191). Multivariate Cox regression showed the elder age, male gender, squamous cell carcinoma (SQC) histology type, poor/undifferentiated grade and a large tumor size were associated with poor LCSS. The subgroup analysis of tumor sizes, histologic types and lymph nodes (LNs) dissection, there were also no significant difference for LCSS between lobectomy and sub-lobar resection. The sub-lobar resection was further divided into segmentectomy or wedge resection, and it demonstrated that no significant differences in LCSS were identified among the treatment subgroups either. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the elder age, poor/undifferentiated grade and a large tumor size were a statistically significant independent factor associated with survival. Conclusion: In terms of LCSS, lobectomy has no significant advantage over sub-lobar resection in elderly patients with stage IA NSCLC if lymph node assessment is performed adequately. The present data may contribute to develop a more suitable surgical treatment strategy for the stage IA elderly NSCLC patients. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Liu, Ren, Li, Wang, Huo, Zhu, Chen, Song and Xu.","lobectomy; NSCLC; propensity score matching; SEER; sub-lobar resection","adult; age; Article; atelectasis; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; comparative study; controlled study; demography; female; gender; histology; human; human experiment; human tissue; lobectomy; lung adenocarcinoma; lymph node; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; marriage; monitoring; non small cell lung cancer; obstructive pneumonia; overall survival; pathology; pleura; propensity score; proportional hazards model; squamous cell carcinoma; surgical technique; survival analysis; tumor volume; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106190601"

The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with stage IA NSCLC who were ineligible for surgery using the surveillance, epidemiology and end-results (SEER) Database. Methods: Using the SEER registry, we identified a total of 6,195 IA NSCLC patients who received SBRT or RFA between 2004 and 2015 because of ineligibility for surgical resection due to various reasons. Complete clinical information was available in all these patients. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared between RFA and SBRT groups by using propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW), and overlap weighting analysis. Additionally, an exploratory analysis was conducted to determine the effectiveness of RFA treatment based on the subsets of clinically relevant patients. Results: Of the 6,195 nonsurgical IA NSCLC patients, 191 patients (3.1%) received RFA and the other 6,004 patients (96.9%) received SBRT. The one-, three- and five-year OS in the unmatched RFA and SBRT groups were 83.3%, 48.5%and 29.1% vs. 83.8%, 48.3% and 27.4%, respectively, there was similar results in the PSM, IPTW, overlap weighing analysis. Nonsurgical IA NSCLC patients receiving RFA seemed to have better five-year survival than those receiving SBRT, though the difference was not statistically significant (OS, HR; 0.986; 95% CI, 0.827-1.175, P=0.8738; CSS, HR; 0.965; 95% CI, 0.765-1.219, P=0.7663). We found that the odds of receiving RFA decreased with larger tumor size (>2, <3 cm, OR; 0.303; 95% CI, 0.191-0.479; >3 cm, OR; 0.153; 95% CI, 0.093-0.251) compared with tumor size <1 cm. In subgroup analysis, patients receiving RFA seemed to have better OS than those receiving SBRT, though the difference was not statistically significant. This specific trend was even more obvious in patients with tumors <1cm in diameter (P=0.1577). Conclusion: In comparison with SBRT, RFA did not seem to adversely affect CSS and OS of IA NSCLC patients who were not suitable for surgical treatment. In addition, RFA seemed to offer better survival to IA NSCLC patients, especially those with tumors <1 cm. © The author(s).","Non-small-cell lung carcinoma; Radiofrequency ablation; Stereotactic body radiotherapy; Survival","adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer survival; chi square test; comparative effectiveness; confidence interval; conservative treatment; controlled study; data analysis software; female; follow up; human; inverse probability of treatment weight; major clinical study; male; Mantel Haenszel test; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; odds ratio; overall survival; overlap weighting analysis; propensity score; radiofrequency ablation; rank sum test; retrospective study; statistical analysis; statistical parameters; statistical significance; stereotactic body radiation therapy; tumor volume","","Ivyspring International Publisher","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105053441"

In this respect, sensorized insoles also have a great potential for extracting gait information. This, combined with mathematical techniques based on machine learning (ML), can potentialize biomechanical analyses. The present study proposes a proof-of-concept of a system based on vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) acquisition with a sensorized insole that uses an ML algorithm to identify different patterns of vGRF and extract biomechanical characteristics that can help during clinical evaluation. The acquired data from the system was clustered by an immunological algorithm (IA) based on vGRF during gait. These clusters underwent a data mining process using the classification and regression tree algorithm (CART), where the main characteristics of each group were extracted, and some rules for gait classification were created. As a result, the system proposed was able to collect and process the biomechanical behavior of gait. After the application of IA and CART algorithms, six groups were found. The characteristics of each of these groups were extracted and verified the capability of the system to collect and process the biomechanical behavior of gait, offering verification points that can help focus during a clinical evaluation. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanics on gait; data mining; gait analysis; machine learning; smart insole","","","MDPI","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144725198"

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anti-NMDAR titer decreased in all patients, and one became negative. Anti-NMDAR levels were tested in two patients at follow-up and found to have declined continuously. All patients exhibited clinical improvement with a mRS decline ≥1 after IA treatment (median mRS: 5.0 [range, 3.0–5.0] vs. 4.0 [range, 2.0–4.0], p = 0.014), and the median mRS decreased to 1.0 (range, 0–3.0) at follow-up. After IA, all patients exhibited accelerated recovery. No adverse events were observed during IA treatment. Conclusion: Protein A IA may be effective for treating IVMP/IVIG-resistant anti-NMDAR encephalitis and well tolerated. It is necessary to initiate larger-scale prospective controlled studies to validate the efficacy and safety of protein A IA in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. © 2021","Anti-NMDAR encephalitis; Protein A immunoadsorption; Refractory","Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis; Antibodies; Humans; Immunoglobulins, Intravenous; Prospective Studies; Staphylococcal Protein A; anticonvulsive agent; azathioprine; immunoglobulin; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor antibody; protein A; steroid; antibody; bevifimod; immunoglobulin; adolescent; adult; anti n methyl d aspartate receptor encephalitis; antibody blood level; antibody detection; antibody titer; Article; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; immunoadsorption; immunosuppressive treatment; immunotherapy; male; middle aged; patient safety; pharmacokinetics; prospective study; Rankin scale; steroid therapy; young adult; anti NMDA receptor encephalitis","","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111786111"

These patients' midterm outcomes are available in the Vascular Quality Initiative for analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in the Vascular Quality Initiative from patients who underwent elective infrarenal EVAR between 2011 and 2018. Each EVAR was identified as either on- or off-instructions for use (IFU) based on aortic neck criteria. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess associations between aneurysm sac enlargement, reintervention, and type Ia endoleak with IFU status. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event models estimated reintervention, aneurysm sac enlargement, and overall survival. RESULTS: We identified 5,488 patients with at least 1 follow-up recorded. Those treated off-IFU included 1,236 patients ([23%] mean follow-up 401 days) compared with 4,252 (77%) treated on-IFU (mean follow-up 406 days). There was no evidence of significant differences in crude 30-day survival (96% vs 97%; p = 0.28) or estimated 2-year survival (97% vs 97%; log-rank p = 0.28). Crude type Ia endoleak frequency was greater in patients treated off IFU (2% vs 1%; p = 0.03). Off-IFU EVAR was associated with type Ia endoleak on multivariable regression model (odds ratio 1.84 [95% CI 1.23 to 2.76]; p = 0.003). Patients treated off IFU vs on IFU experienced had increased risk of reintervention within 2 years (7% vs 5%; log-rank p = 0.02), a finding consistent with results from the Cox modeling (hazard ratio 1.38 [95% CI 1.06 to 1.81]; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated off IFU were at greater risk for type Ia endoleak and reintervention, although they had similar 2-year survival compared with those treated on IFU. Patients with anatomy outside IFU should be considered for open surgery or complex endovascular repair to reduce the probability for revision. Copyright © 2023 by the American College of Surgeons.

The present study aimed to investigate whether chemotherapy is indispensable for patients with stage IA OCCC. Methods: Data were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database between 2004 and 2015. All subjects were diagnosed with stage IA OCCC, according to their postoperative pathological reports. In the present study, 1038 patients were retrospectively investigated, among whom 692 patients received chemotherapy. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to prevent selection bias. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the correlation between variables and 5-year overall survival. Results: An equal number of patients (n = 346) who did or did not undergo chemotherapy after PSM were further enrolled in the study. The results showed that the mortality of OCCC increased for the patients aged ≥50 years. In addition, older age was associated with lower 5-year overall survival (p < 0.05). However, chemotherapy did not extend the 5-year overall survival (p = 0.524) of patients with stage IA OCCC, according to the multivariate Cox regression analysis. Conclusions: Chemotherapy did not affect the overall survival of patients with stage IA OCCC following surgery. © 2022 The Authors.

Identifying visit-level outliers from longitudinal data with continuous time-dependent covariates is important when the distribution of such variable is highly skewed. Objectives: The primary objective was to identify potential outliers at follow-up visits using interquartile range (IQR) statistic and assess their influence on estimated Cox regression parameters. Methods: Study was motivated by a large TEDDY dietary longitudinal and time-to-event data with a continuous time-varying vitamin B12 intake as the exposure of interest and development of Islet Autoimmunity (IA) as the response variable. An IQR algorithm was applied to the TEDDY dataset to detect potential outliers at each visit. To assess the impact of detected outliers, data were analyzed using the extended time-dependent Cox model with robust sandwich estimator. Partial residual diagnostic plots were examined for highly influential outliers. Results: Extreme vitamin B12 observations that were cases of IA had a stronger influence on the Cox regression model than non-cases. Identified outliers changed the direction of hazard ratios, standard errors, or the strength of association with the risk of developing IA. Conclusion: At the exploratory data analysis stage, the IQR algorithm can be used as a data quality control tool to identify potential outliers at the visit level, which can be further investigated. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2023.","","Data Accuracy; Diet; Humans; Vitamins; cyanocobalamin; HLA DR3 antigen; HLA DR4 antigen; vitamin; Article; child; data analysis; disease association; female; Finland; follow up; food intake; genotype; Germany; hazard ratio; human; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; outlier detection; preschool child; proportional hazards model; quality control; risk assessment; school child; statistical analysis; Sweden; time; United States; vitamin intake; data accuracy; diet","","Springer Nature","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181259126"

Therefore, we sought to determine whether patients with stage I EOOC had improved overall survival (OS) following receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: Patients with pathological stage I ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Demographics, pathologic factors including tumor grade, and treatment information including receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy were collected. The impact of chemotherapy on OS was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier curves, and compared with log-rank tests. Multivariate Cox analysis was performed to control for confounders. Results: A total of 4538 patients were identified and the median age was 55 years The rate of adjuvant chemotherapy use was 50.9%. Higher rates were noted among patients with stage IC and grade 3 tumors. Following stratification by tumor grade, substage and extent of lymphadenectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a survival benefit for patients with grade 2 tumors who did not undergo (stage IA/IB: 95.7% vs 83%, p = 0.038; stage IC: 84.5% vs 84.8%, p = 0.39) or had limited lymphadenectomy (stage IA/IB: 96% vs 89.5%, p = 0.03; stage IC: 97.2% vs 83.9%, p = 0.001). A survival difference was also seen for patients with grade 3 tumors who did not undergo lymphadenectomy but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an overall survival benefit for patients with inadequately-staged, grade 2 stage I ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma. A possible benefit for inadequately-staged patients with grade 3 tumors cannot be excluded. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carcinoma; Chemotherapy; Endometrioid; Ovary","Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Ovarian Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; United States; antineoplastic agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; Article; cancer staging; clinical feature; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; insurance; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; middle aged; ovary adenocarcinoma; overall survival; priority journal; survival rate; adjuvant chemotherapy; cancer grading; endometrioid carcinoma; epidemiology; factual database; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; ovary tumor; pathology; retrospective study; survival analysis; United States","","Academic Press Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076475765"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between tumor size and prognosis in patients with T1 ICC. The data regarding patients with ICC was downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between January 2004 and December 2013, at the time of first diagnosis and entered into the database. Demographic and pathological characteristics of patients were analyzed using an independent t-test and χ2 test. Overall survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis; the cut-off point for tumor size was determined using the X-tile software. A total of 407 patients with ICC were selected from the analysis, including 199 cases with stage IA and 208 cases with stage IB tumors. The independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IA ICC were age and surgery. Independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IB ICC included age, surgery (yes vs. no) and tumor size (5-7 vs. ≥7 cm). The optimal cut-off value for tumor size was determined to be ~7 cm using X-tile software. Tumor size with a cut-off value of 7 cm could stratify patients by risk better than a value of 5 cm [hazard ratio (HR), 1.775; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.356-2.323 and; HR, 1.402; 95% CI, 1.078-1.824, respectively]. This suggests that the T1 tumor category should be subclassified into T1a and T1b with a cut-off of 7 cm rather than 5 cm. The next edition of the AJCC staging system may take the present evidence into consideration for improvement regarding the accurate staging of ICC. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

Objective: This study aimed to assess stage-specific survival in BC between Chinese and White American women according to the eighth AJCC PPS. Methods: We included Chinese and White American women with BC diagnosed between 2010 and 2018 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. A chi-square test, the Kaplan–Meier method, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used for data analysis. Results: We included 376,818 individuals in this study: 369,522 White American and 7296 Chinese. Of them, 149,452 (39.7%) migrated from the seventh AJCC anatomic staging (AS) to the eighth AJCC PPS, 22,516 (6.0%) were upstaged, and 126,936 (33.7%) were downstaged. With a median follow-up duration of 44 months, the 5-year overall survival and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for the entire group were 87.4% and 95.9%, respectively. The seventh AJCC AS (P<.001) and the eighth AJCC PPS (P<.001) could significantly predict the survival outcomes of BC, and multivariate analysis revealed that both staging systems were significant prognostic indicators of CSS. The ROC curve revealed that the PPS had a better discriminating ability than the AS (area under the curve [AUC] 0.769 vs 0.753, P<.001). Similar trends were observed after stratification by the 2 ethnic groups. The eighth AJCC PPS had better discriminating ability than the seventh AJCC AS among both White American (AUC 0.769 vs 0.753, P<.001) and Chinese patients (AUC 0.790 vs 0.776, P<.001). In the seventh AJCC AS, Chinese women had better CSS in stage IA (P=.02), stage IIA (P=.005), and stage IIIB (P=.04) disease than White American women, but no significant CSS was observed in stage IB, IIB, IIIA, and IIIC disease between the 2 ethnic groups. Regarding the eighth AJCC PPS, Chinese women had better CSS in stage IA (P=.002) and IIIA (P=.046) disease than White American women, and CSS was similar in Chinese and White American women in other substages. Conclusions: The eighth AJCC PPS has a similar discriminative ability between White American and Chinese individuals with BC compared with the seventh AJCC AS. Therefore, the eighth AJCC PPS is also applicable to Chinese individuals with BC. © Jun Wang, Juan Zhou, Lei Liu, San-Gang Wu.","AJCC; AJCC stage; American Joint Committee on Cancer; breast cancer; cancer-specific survival; Chinese; epidemiology; overall survival; pathological prognostic staging; staging; surveillance; survival; White American","Breast Neoplasms; China; Data Analysis; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Neoplasm Staging; Whites; breast tumor; cancer staging; Caucasian; China; data analysis; epidemiology; female; human; Kaplan Meier method","","JMIR Publications Inc.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142400871"

We attempted to assess PTS as a prognosticator for overall survival (OS) in CS IA seminoma and to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of active surveillance (AS) versus adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with large primary tumors (LPT). Methods and materials: In the National Cancer Database (2004–2014), 2455 (47.7%) and 2685 (52.3%) patients with CS IA seminoma were treated with AS and AT, respectively. AT was defined as the receipt of chemotherapy or radiation within 3 months after orchiectomy. A cut-point analysis was performed to determine the optimal PTS threshold predicting OS at 5 years after orchiectomy. Inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were used to compare OS of patients with LPT (using the optimal PTS cut-point) treated with AS versus AT. Results: In adjusted analysis, pathologic T-stage (pT1a vs. pT1b) did not predict OS and no OS benefit was noted in pT1b patients treated with AT. The optimal PTS cut-point was 4.5 cm. In multivariable analysis, patients with LPT (≥4.5 cm) had an increased risk of overall mortality (HR = 1.87, P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that OS was superior in patients with LPT treated with AT (IPTW-adjusted log-rank P = 0.029). In IPTW-adjusted Cox regression analysis, AT was associated with an OS benefit in patients with LPT (HR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.39–0.91, P = 0.017). Conclusions: In this National Cancer Database analysis, PTS was a predictor of OS in CS IA seminoma. An OS benefit was noted for individuals with LPT (defined as PTS ≥4.5 cm) managed with AT.

There were significantly better outcomes in the IA group than in the EA group in time to first flatus (mean difference (MD) 0.71 (95 per cent c.i. 1.12 to 0.31), P=0.0005), time to first passage of stool (MD 0.53 (95 per cent c.i. 0.69 to 0.37), P<0.00001), visual analogue scale of pain on postoperative day (POD) 3 (MD 0.76 (95 per cent c.i. 1.23 to 0.28), P=0.002), POD 4 (MD 0.83 (95 per cent c.i. 1.46 to 0.20), P=0.01), POD 5 (MD 0.60 (95 per cent c.i. 0.95 to 0.25), P=0.0007), length of incision (MD 1.52 (95 per cent c.i. 2.30 to 0.74), P=0.0001) and wound infection (relative risk 0.46 (95 per cent c.i. 0.23 to 0.91), P=0.02). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in duration of hospital stay (P=0.47), operative time (P=0.07), number of lymph nodes harvested (P=0.70), anastomotic leak (P=0.88), postoperative ileus (P=0.48), bleeding (P=0.15), bowel obstruction (P=0.24), reoperation (P=0.34), readmission within 30 days (P=0.26), and death (P=0.70). Conclusion: Compared with EA, IA shows a faster recovery of bowel function with fewer wound infections. © The Author(s) 2021.

Exploring the risk factors for IA rupture and taking preventive measures accordingly can reduce or prevent the occurrence of SAH. Currently, there is still no consensus on the detrimental factors for IA rupture. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the risk factors of IA rupture in a population of northern China. Methods: We systematically collected the demographic features, medical history, and imaging data of aneurysms from patients with ruptured and unruptured IAs (UIAs) who attended the Department of Neurosurgery at the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University from 2014 to 2019. All cases had been diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography. We excluded patients with SAH resulting from injuries, as well as those with vascular dissection and incomplete data. Finally, 1,214 patients including 616 with ruptured IAs and 598 with UIAs were collected for further analysis. A case-control study was conducted, in which multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for IA rupture. Results: Our multivariable logistic regression showed that anterior cerebral artery [odds ratio (OR) =2.413; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.235-4.718], anterior communicating artery (OR =3.952; 95% CI: 2.601-6.006), posterior communicating artery (OR =2.385; 95% CI: 1.790-3.177), and anterior circulation branches (OR =3.493; 95% CI: 1.422-8.581) were risk factors for IA rupture, whereas patients with a history of cerebral infarction (OR =0.395; 95% CI: 0.247-0.631) and those with IAs located in the internal carotid artery (OR =0.403; 95% CI: 0.292-0.557) were less likely to have IA rupture. Conclusions: IAs at specific locations are prone to rupture. These IAs should be paid particular attention and preventive measures should be taken to reduce or prevent their rupture. © 2024 AME Publishing Company.

And they play an important role to collect the sensing data of Internet of Things (IoT). However, limited by the load capability, it is a big challenge for them to perform long-term, large range, or far distance tasks. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose to use assembly UAVs, in which we can jointly optimize the resource management, especially, the energy resource. The system model, energy cyclic cooperation, and one of the typical applications based on assembly UAVs are introduced. The energy cooperation problems are formulated and an in-air replenishing strategy (IA-RS) is proposed. Simulations show that the performances of the proposed IA-RS outperform those of the traditional on-ground replenishing strategy (OG-RS). The working time of task UAV (UAV-T) could reduce 8.3%-19.5%, and the freshness of the collected data and the collecting efficiency of the UAV-T can be improved. We also optimize the path of the replenishing UAVs (UAV-Rs). Simulations show that the proposed reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm has the best performances and acceptable complexity. Consequently, the efficiency of the IoT data collection task is improved by the proposed assembly UAVs.  © 2014 IEEE.","Assembly unmanned air vehicles (UAVs); data collection of Internet of Things (IoT); reinforcement learning (RL); resource cooperation","Antennas; Data acquisition; Energy resources; Information management; Internet of things; Job analysis; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Assembly unmanned air vehicle; Data collection; Data collection of internet of thing; Reinforcement learnings; Resource cooperation; Resource management; Shape; Task analysis; Unmanned air vehicles; Wireless communications; Reinforcement learning","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142858883"

The traditional detection methods rely on manual inspection and can be inaccurate and inefficient, while the existing deep learning-based methods, such as the Mask R-CNN detection method, have insufficient precision for detecting minor defects since the anchor scales design does not consider small defects. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes an IA-Mask R-CNN detection method with an improved anchor scales design. First, an image dataset that contains 560 pictures of surface defects of automotive engine parts is established using a 1080P HDMI high-definition digital microscope capable of recording three million real pixels and labeled manually. Then, the anchor scales suitable for the surface defect detection of automotive engine parts are determined by labeled data analysis and used to improve the anchor design in Mask R-CNN. Finally, the proposed method is compared experimentally with the Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, and qualitative and quantitative analyses are conducted. The experimental results show that, without increasing the number of parameters or training time of the Mask R-CNN, the proposed method performed better in detecting minor, as well as larger defects than the other detection methods. © 2022 by the authors.

The security and protection of such data has become increasingly critical. As the sensor technology rapid developed, the diversity of sensors on smartphones has greatly increased (e.g., motion sensor and touchscreen sensor), empowering the smartphones to provide continuous and implicit user authentication by capturing behavioral biometrics. Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to make full use of the data from the multimodality sensors to provide accurate authentication. Toward this end, in this article, we develop an implicit authentication (IA) framework AttAuth which explores organic integration of such multimodality data to authenticate smartphone users through the usage session. Specifically, AttAuth first develops a series of data processing techniques to process the multichannel motion sensor data and the discrete touchscreen data. Then, a temporal and channelwise attention-based temporal and channelwise attention recurrent neural network (TCA-RNN) is developed to build authentication model, which allows to jointly model continuously monitored motion sensor data and irregularly recorded discrete touchscreen data effectively. By generating a guidance vector based on touch events, TCA-RNN guides the temporalwise attention mechanism on the processed multichannel motion sensor data and outputs authentication results. We evaluate AttAuth on a real-world multimodality smartphone usage data set of 100 users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AttAuth achieves the state-of-the-art authentication accuracy. Additional experiments are provided to examine the applicability of AttAuth in terms of running overheads and sensitivity to various application scenarios.  © 2014 IEEE.","Implicit authentication (IA); neural networks; privacy protection","Authentication; Behavioral research; Biometrics; Feature extraction; Motion analysis; Recurrent neural networks; Sensitive data; Touch screens; Behavioral science; Biometric (access control); Features extraction; Implicit authentications; Motion detection; Motion sensors; Multi-modality; Neural-networks; Privacy protection; Smart phones; Smartphones","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171528941"

Materials and Methods: Three hundred twelve patients with biopsy-proven node-negative early-stage (IA–IIA) lung adenocarcinoma met the inclusion criteria for this study. Demographics data and histopathological findings were collected from medical records. Computed tomography (CT) performed approximately 1 month before surgery was manually scored using 23 CT descriptors. Univariate analyses were applied to demonstrate an association between clinicopathological and radiological features and 2-/5-year recurrences. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the ability of radiological and clinicopathological features to discriminate low and high-risk factors for recurrence. A ROC curve was used to evaluate prediction performance. Results: Univariate analysis revealed that the 2-year recurrence was associated with six radiological features and two clinicopathological features, while 5-year recurrence was associated with five radiological features and two clinicopathological features. A multivariate logistic regression model of combined clinicopathological and radiological features showed that stage IIA (OR = 2.87), solid texture (solid part > 50 %: OR = 4.81; solid part = 100 %: OR = 3.61), pleural attachment (OR = 3.97) and bronchovascular bundle thickening (OR = 2.16) were associated with the independent predictors of 2-year recurrence, and stage IIA (OR = 3.52), solid texture (solid part > 50 %: OR = 3.56; solid part = 100 %: OR = 2.44) and pleural attachment (OR = 4.57) were associated with 5-year recurrence. Combined radiological and clinicopathological features could be significant indicators of 2- and 5-year recurrences (AUC = 0.784 and AUC = 0.815, respectively). Conclusions: The combination of radiological and clinicopathological features has the potential to help predict postoperative recurrence in patients with stage IA–IIA lung adenocarcinomas and guide oncologists and patients whether to undergo additional treatment after surgery. © 2021","Clinicopathological features; Computed tomography; Node-negative early-stage lung adenocarcinomas; Recurrence","Adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; adult; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; early cancer; female; high risk patient; histopathology; human; human tissue; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; prediction; reproducibility; retrospective study; skin biopsy; adenocarcinoma; cancer staging; diagnostic imaging; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; pathology; prognosis; tumor recurrence","","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107367518"

This study aims to compare three types of N classifications, including location-based N classification (pathologic nodal classification [pN]), the number of lymph node stations (nS)-based N classification (nS classification), and the combined approach proposed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) which incorporates both pN and nS classification to determine if the nS classification is more appropriate for early-stage lung cancer. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of lung cancer patients treated at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between 2005 and 2018. Inclusion criteria was clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent resection during this period. Sub-analyses were performed for the three types of N classifications. The optimal cutoff values for nS classification were determined with X-tile software. Kaplan‒Meier and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to assess the prognostic significance of the different N classifications. The prediction performance among the three types of N classifications was compared using the concordance index (C-index) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Of the 669 patients evaluated, 534 had pathological stage N0 disease (79.8%), 82 had N1 disease (12.3%) and 53 had N2 disease (7.9%). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that all three types of N classifications were independent prognostic factors for prognosis (all P < 0.001). However, the prognosis overlaps between pN (N1 and N2, P = 0.052) and IASLC-proposed N classification (N1b and N2a1 [P = 0.407], N2a1 and N2a2 [P = 0.364], and N2a2 and N2b [P = 0.779]), except for nS classification subgroups (nS0 and nS1 [P < 0.001] and nS1 and nS >1 [P = 0.006]). There was no significant difference in the C-index values between the three N classifications (P = 0.370). The DCA results demonstrated that the nS classification provided greater clinical utility. Conclusion: The nS classification might be a better choice for nodal classification in clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. © 2023","Clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma; IASLC-proposed N classifications; N classification; Number of involved nodal stations; Pathologic nodal classification","adult; Article; cancer center; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; disease free survival; excision; female; follow up; human; Kaplan Meier method; lobectomy; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; lymph node; major clinical study; male; physical examination; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; prediction; primary tumor; retrospective study; risk factor; survival analysis; survival rate; survival time; thorax radiography","","Chinese National Cancer Center","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165005739"

Methods: This is a cohort study that retrospectively analyzed data of patients with AIS who underwent EVT and achieved successful recanalization from a prospective registry. Eligible patients were divided into three groups according to their use of tirofiban. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline bias. Safety outcomes included any intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and symptomatic ICH (sICH). Efficacy outcomes included arterial reocclusion, in-hospital mortality, 3-month mortality, and 3-month functional outcomes. Results: We included 821 patients with 306 in the no tirofiban group, 202 in the IA + IV tirofiban group, and 313 in the IV tirofiban group. After PSM, each group included 101 patients with balanced baseline characteristics. There was no difference between the IV tirofiban group and the no tirofiban group in terms of safety and efficacy outcomes (all p > 0.05). Compared with no tirofiban, IA + IV tirofiban group did not increase ICH (30.7% vs. 37.6%, p > 0.05) and sICH (6.9% vs. 17.8%, p > 0.05) whereas reduced 3-month mortality (14.3% vs. 28.7%, p < 0.05) and improved 3-month modified Rankin Scale (median 3 vs. 4, p < 0.05). Conclusions: A low dose of tirofiban, regardless of their administration routes, was safe for AIS patients who achieved successful recanalization with EVT, whereas only IA + IV tirofiban improved clinical outcomes. © 2022 The Authors.

In phase I drug development, a global problem of unknown magnitude is the multiplicity of similar drugs being investigated against the same target, colloquially known as the ‘me too’ phenomenon. Methods: Ranging from December 2020 to December 2022 we annotated phase I clinical trials present on clinicaltrials.gov. Public databases were queried for annotation of investigational agents (IAs). Extensive literature research and data mining were performed to annotate agents not present in public databases. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer sequencing cohort was used to perform second-level analyses to evaluate tumour types with a higher number of IA matches. Results: A total of 1054 unique drug targets were identified. The most frequent IA classes were: cell products (1223), small-molecule inhibitors (1110), antibodies (733), and vaccines (346). Only a minority (8.9%) of phase I IAs were explored against a target without a competitive agent; 7% of agents shared targets with 2–3 other agents. Unfortunately, the majority (84%) shared targets with at least four other agents. Using data from the TCGA pan-cancer sequencing potentially underserved histologies were identified. Analysis of alteration-IA matches revealed potentially frequent and unexplored alterations in many tumour types. Conclusions: The majority of IAs (86%) shared targets with at least three other agents. We argue that these duplicative efforts could be redirected toward unmet needs instead. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Early drug development; Precision medicine; TCGA","Drug Development; Humans; Neoplasms; antibody; antibody drug conjugate; antineoplastic agent; monoclonal antibody; nucleic acid; oncolytic virus; peptide; peptide vaccine; tumor antigen; vaccine; Article; data base; data mining; drug development; drug targeting; gene mutation; gene therapy; genetic profile; hematologic malignancy; human; oncolytic virotherapy; personalized medicine; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); solid tumor; whole genome sequencing; drug development; genetics; neoplasm","","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164662066"

Case presentation: We analyzed and summarized the clinical data and genetic test results from a patient with IGHD admitted in March 2019 to the Department of Pediatrics Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. We described the results from a 1-year-9-months old female, whose chief complaint was “growth retardation for more than one year”. Her birth length was 49.0 cm, and her birth weight was 3.05 kg. Suboptimal intake (breastfeeding) jaundice lasted for approximately two months following birth. When evaluated at the age of 1-year-9-months old, the patient’s height was 61.0 cm (− 7.24 SD), and her weight was 6.4 kg (− 1.50 SD). The patient’s physical characteristics included yellowish hair, large and unclosed anterior fontanelles, raised forehead, and a low and flat nose. The major abnormalities observed from the auxiliary examinations included low GH (< 0.05 μg/l), low IGF-1 (16.99 μg/l), and elevated TSH (6.97 mIU/l). Genetic testing revealed two heterozygous variants: a splicing mutation (NG_011676.1(NM_022560.4): c.10 + 1G>T, inherited from her mother) in intron 1 of the GH1 gene and a deletion that encompassed the same gene (chr17: 61973811–61996255, inherited from her father). After hormone replacement therapy with L-thyroxine and recombinant human GH (rhGH), the patient’s thyroid function returned to normal, and her serum IGF-1 level significantly improved, which resulted in an accelerated increase in height. Conclusion: This study described a case of IGHD caused by novel compound heterozygous mutations in the GH1 gene. This study suggested that closer attention should be directed to genetic testing and diagnosis based on clinical characteristics to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2021, The Author(s).","Gene; GH1; Isolated growth hormone deficiency; Mutation","Dwarfism, Pituitary; glucose; growth hormone; insulin; levothyroxine; recombinant growth hormone; somatomedin C; thyrotropin; Article; body height; body weight; case report; child; chromosome 17; clinical article; copy number variation; female; gene; gene mutation; GH1 gene; growth hormone deficiency; growth retardation; heterozygote; hormone substitution; human; isolated growth hormone deficiency type IA; jaundice; pedigree analysis; preschool child; Sanger sequencing; splicing mutation; whole exome sequencing; pituitary dwarfism","","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114054206"

For example, the virtual nature, vulnerability, and uncertainty of online communication lead to reduced online trust, causing interaction anxiety (IA). The data footprints left on the Internet are processed by malicious elements for big data, leading to the leakage of personal privacy data, bringing content sharing anxiety (SAC) and privacy concern anxiety (PAC), which are all typical forms of online social anxiety. In the face of this situation, analyzing the influence of online social networking on the social psychology of university students and guiding it has become an inevitable issue in the Internet era. Methods: Learning from the classification of family environment, a self-administered family process factor questionnaire and the Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media Users (SAS-SMU) were used to investigate the online social anxiety of Guangxi University students. The study used SPSS26.0 and Stata for data analysis and descriptive statistics, ANOVA, t-test, and linear regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between family process factors and online social anxiety of the university students. Results: The results showed that except for parental supervision (p > 0.05), the effects of interparental relationship, parent-child relationship, sibling relationship, and family atmosphere on university students' online social anxiety were statistically significant and showed positive correlations (F/t = 6.64, 3.53, 4.15, 5.94; p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that university students' total online social anxiety score = 36.914−4.09 × good parental relationship−4.16 × good family atmosphere−3.42 × good sibling relationship. Conclusions: Based on the family systems theory, it is suggested that a comprehensive intervention should be conducted for the coupled system (parental relationship) and sibling system (non-only child's sibling relationship) in the family and focus on the protective factors of parental harmony, sibling relationship harmony, and relaxed family atmosphere. In the specific implementation method, the collaborative shared healthcare plan (CSHCP) can be used to strengthen remote family emotional interaction and avoid Internet addiction. For university students with online social anxiety disorders, their personal health records (PHRs) can be maintained permanently and safely using the Star File System (IPFS), in addition to the convenience of IPFS data extraction, which is more conducive to the timely and long-term tracking treatment of anxious university students.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy among the staging groups of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for PDAC. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis was performed by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) (2004–2015) database and multi-institutional dataset (2010–2018). Baseline clinicopathologic characteristics of PDAC patients, including age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education level, county income level, county unemployed rate, insurance status, grade, stage, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, were collected. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. The SEER and multi-institutional data were adjusted with 1:1 ratio propensity score matching (PSM). Results: In total, 6,274 and 1,361 PDAC patients were included from the SEER database and multi-institutional dataset, respectively. Regardless of the count of resected lymph nodes, adjuvant chemotherapy prolonged the long-term OS time for stage IB, IIA, IIB, and III patients in both SEER and multi-institutional cohorts. Nevertheless, adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide additional clinical benefits even after a PSM adjustment for stage IA patients in both SEER and multi-institutional cohorts. Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy improved the long-term survival of stage IB, IIA, IIB, and III PDAC patients; however, it demonstrated no survival benefit in stage IA PDAC patients. Thus, adjuvant chemotherapy should not be recommended for stage IA PDAC patients. These would significantly reduce the economic burden of society and improve the life quality of stage IA PDAC patients. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Xu, Chen, Wei, Zhou, Chen, Shen and Wang.","chemotherapy; End Results (SEER); Epidemiology; overall survival; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; prognosis; Surveillance","adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer localization; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cohort analysis; disease free survival; disease specific survival; female; follow up; histology; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; propensity score; quality of life; retrospective study; survival analysis; very elderly","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088972202"

For the three fundamental sectors in China's industrial systems, namely the smelting and pressing of nonferrous metals (SPNFM), the processing of petroleum, coking, and nuclear fuel (PPCNF); and the manufacturing of nonmetallic mineral products (MNMMP), we employed a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to measure GE in the fundamental sectors in 30 provinces from 2010 to 2015. We then adopted a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) model to evaluate the influence of technological innovation (TI), industrial agglomeration (IA), environmental regulation (ER), and intraindustry competition (IC). The results showed that GE in the three fundamental sectors varied spatially. Specifically, TI promoted GE in MNMMP, but the effect was not obvious in the SPNFM and PPCNF sectors. Moreover, ER had positive impacts on GE in the fundamental sectors. The effects of IA and IC on GE in the fundamental sectors varied in direction and strength. After eliminating the impacts of environmental effects and statistical noise, the real GE in the three fundamental sectors varied significantly compared to the comprehensive GE. Policy opportunities for enhancing GE in the fundamental sectors mainly lie in region-specific policy and regulations that avoid a “one-size-fits-all” governance approach. © 2021 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.","Fundamental sectors; Green efficiency; Spatial differences; Three-stage DEA","","","KeAi Communications Co.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102773902"

Nevertheless, some patients discontinue their first-line treatment; for them, one option may be a subsequent line of the same treatment class (i.e., cycling). The aim of this study was to assess treatment persistence between first- and second-line therapy in Swedish IA patients cycling on SC-TNFis. Methods: Using data from the Swedish Health Data Registers, adult IA patients filling prescriptions between May 1, 2010, and October 31, 2016, for a SC-TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and golimumab) were included. Treatment persistence was derived based on information from filled prescriptions and a 60-day grace period. Unadjusted and adjusted marginal Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate the relative risk of discontinuation across treatment lines, using robust sandwich covariance matrix estimates to account for intrapatient dependence (i.e., multiple treatment lines per patient). The analysis was restricted to the first two lines of treatment. Results: Of the eligible patients, 3181 were identified as cyclers. Among these, most were female (68%), and 46%, 28% and 26% were diagnosed with RA, AS and PsA, respectively. Both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses showed that the relative risk of discontinuing SC-TNFi treatment was significantly lower in second compared to first line (hazard ratio; 0.60 [0.57, 0.63] and HR; 0.59 [0.56, 0.62]). This finding was also consistent across IA indications. Conclusions: In this study of patients cycling on SC-TNFis in IA, persistence was greater in second- compared to first-line treatment. The finding was consistent across all IA indications. Hence, patients who discontinue their first-line treatment may still benefit from treatment with an alternative SC-TNFi as a second-line therapy in IA. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Healthcare Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Ankylosing spondylitis; Biologics; Cycling; Inflammatory arthritis; Psoriatic arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors; Treatment persistence","Adult; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Etanercept; Female; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; adalimumab; certolizumab pegol; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; golimumab; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; steroid; antirheumatic agent; etanercept; tumor necrosis factor; adult; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; biological therapy; Charlson Comorbidity Index; female; hospitalization; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; middle aged; monoclonal antibody therapy; observational study; outpatient care; patient registry; prescription; psoriatic arthritis; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; steroid therapy; survival rate; treatment duration; treatment withdrawal; psoriatic arthritis","","Adis","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114176584"

We evaluated if expanded RS criteria can be considered for downstaging in AJCC pathologic prognostic staging. Methods: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, we identified patients with T1-3N0-3M0 hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer treated from 2010 to 2015 with follow-up data through 2016. We evaluated TNM categories, grade, and RS result. The primary outcome measured was 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) of patients with low-risk RS results not already pathologic prognostic stage IA, determined by T and N categories per AJCC eighth edition. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: Of 154 050 patients with median follow-up of 49 months (range = 0-83), RS results were obtained in 60 886 (39.5%): RS was less than 11 in 13 570 (22.3%); 11-17 in 22 719 (37.3%); 18-25 in 16 521 (27.1%); and 26 or higher in 8076 (13.3%). Five-year DSS for pathologic prognostic stage IA patients (n = 114 910, 74.6%) was 98.8%. Among N0-1 patients with a RS less than 18 not staged as pathologic prognostic stage IA by current criteria, 5-year DSS was excellent and not statistically significantly different than for pathologic prognostic stage IA patients (97.2%-99.7%; P >. 05). For those with a RS of 18-25, there was a small decrease in DSS for T2N0 (2.3%) and modest decrease for T1-2N1 (4.2%-6.4%) compared with pathologic prognostic stage IA patients (P <. 001). Conclusion: Patients with a RS less than 18 have excellent 5-year DSS regardless of T category for N0-1 disease suggesting further modification of the AJCC staging system using this cutoff.  © 2021 The Author(s).

However, for the plant fungal pathogens, mitogenome variations and their roles during the host infection processes remain largely unknown. Rhizoctonia solani, an important soil-borne pathogen, forms different anastomosis groups (AGs) and adapts to a broad range of hosts in nature. Here, we reported three complete mitogenomes of AG1-IA RSIA1, AG1-IB RSIB1, and AG1-IC, and performed a comparative analysis with nine published Rhizoctonia mitogenomes (AG1-IA XN, AG1-IB 7/3/14, AG3, AG4, and five Rhizoctonia sp. mitogenomes). These mitogenomes encoded 15 typical proteins (cox1-3, cob, atp6, atp8-9, nad1-6, nad4L, and rps3) and several LAGLIDADG/GIY-YIG endonucleases with sizes ranging from 109,017 bp (Rhizoctonia sp. SM) to 235,849 bp (AG3). We found that their large sizes were mainly contributed by repeat sequences and genes encoding endonucleases. We identified the complete sequence of the rps3 gene in 10 Rhizoctonia mitogenomes, which contained 14 positively selected sites. Moreover, we inferred a robust maximum-likelihood phylogeny of 32 Basidiomycota mitogenomes, representing that seven R. solani and other five Rhizoctonia sp. lineages formed two parallel branches in Agaricomycotina. The comparative analysis showed that mitogenomes of Basidiomycota pathogens had high GC content and mitogenomes of R. solani had high repeat content. Compared to other strains, the AG1-IC strain had low substitution rates, which may affect its mitochondrial phylogenetic placement in the R. solani clade. Additionally, with the published RNA-seq data, we investigated gene expression patterns from different AGs during host infection stages. The expressed genes from AG1-IA (host: rice) and AG3 (host: potato) mainly formed four groups by k-mean partitioning analysis. However, conserved genes represented varied expression patterns, and only the patterns of rps3-nad2 and nad1-m3g18/mag28 (an LAGLIDADG endonuclease) were conserved in AG1-IA and AG3 as shown by the correlation coefficient analysis, suggesting regulation of gene repertoires adapting to infect varied hosts. The results of variations in mitogenome characteristics and the gene substitution rates and expression patterns may provide insights into the evolution of R. solani mitogenomes. © Copyright © 2021 Lin, Xia, Liu, Zhang, Xiang, Niu, Jiang, Wang and Zheng.","evolution; expression pattern; mitogenome; positive selection; Rhizoctonia solani","adenosine triphosphate; cytochrome c oxidase; endonuclease; transfer RNA; anastomosis; Article; bacterium identification; Basidiomycetes; Cantharellus cibarius; cladistics; comparative genomics; DNA base composition; gene expression; gene sequence; gene structure; infectious agent; maximum likelihood method; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogenomics; phylogeny; plant pathogen interaction; potato; protein expression; protein structure; Rhizoctonia solani; rice; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; sequence alignment; signal transduction; substitution reaction","","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116483603"
